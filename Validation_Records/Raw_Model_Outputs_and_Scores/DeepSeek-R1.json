    "reference_answer": "Organic ammonium salts like formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by incorporating into the perovskite lattice during the synthesis process. They passivate defects through charge compensation, where their cations balance the charge of defects, reducing non-radiative recombination losses. For crystallization, they influence the growth kinetics and morphology of perovskite crystals, promoting a more ordered structure. This leads to improved charge carrier mobility and better device performance, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells.",

Here's a mechanistic breakdown:\n\n---\n\n**1. Crystallization Modulation**  \nOAS alter nucleation kinetics via competitive coordination with Pb²⁺. During solution processing, FA⁺/MA⁺ ions transiently coordinate with [PbI₆]⁴⁻ octahedra, slowing crystal growth by:  \n- **Entropic stabilization**: Increased configurational entropy from mobile OAS delays phase segregation.  \n- **Solvation shell regulation**: OAS modify precursor colloid stability, favoring homogeneous nucleation.  \n\nThis results in larger grains (reduced grain boundaries) and improved crystallographic orientation, suppressing pinhole formation and enhancing charge transport.\n\n---\n\n**2. Defect Passivation Mechanisms**  \nOAS address undercoordinated Pb²⁺ and halide vacancies (Vₓ) through:  \n- **Electrostatic compensation**: FA⁺/MA⁺ adsorb at Pb-I antisites (Pbₐₙₜᵢ), neutralizing charged defects via Coulombic interactions.  \n- **Steric shielding**: Bulky organic cations (e.g., when using excess FA⁺) occupy A-site vacancies, preventing iodide migration pathways.  \n- **Surface termination**: At grain boundaries, OAS form 2D perovskite phases (e.g., (FA)₂PbI₄) that passivate interfacial defects while maintaining charge extraction.  \n\nThis reduces trap density (Nₜ) from ~10¹⁶ to 10¹⁴ cm⁻³, increasing carrier lifetimes (τ > 1 μs) and Voc by 50-100 mV.\n\n---\n\n**3. Stability Enhancement**  \nOAS improve environmental and phase stability through:  \n- **Hydrogen bonding networks**: FA⁺ forms stronger N-H⋯I bonds than MA⁺, resisting moisture ingress.  \n- **Strain relaxation**: Optimal FA⁺/MA⁺ ratios minimize lattice mismatch-induced microstrain (ε < 0.2%).  \n- **Halide immobilization**: Occupied A-sites reduce iodide vacancy mobility (activation energy ↑ 0.15 eV).  \n\n---\n\n**Device Impact**  \nThese mechanisms synergize to boost PCE (25.7% certified for FA-dominant systems) and operational stability (T₈₀ > 1,000 h under 1 Sun).

Chemical Nature & Coordination Mechanisms**  \nOrganic additives (e.g., MACl, DMSO) typically contain functional groups (-NH₂, C=O) that coordinate with Pb²+ through Lewis acid-base interactions. This forms intermediate adducts (e.g., PbI₂·DMSO complexes) that modulate crystallization kinetics. In contrast, inorganic additives (e.g., excess PbI₂, CsBr) interact through ionic substitution or interstitial incorporation. For instance, Cs⁺ substitutes for FA⁺/MA⁺ cations, while excess Pb²+ occupies A-site vacancies.\n\n**2. Defect Mitigation Pathways**  \nOrganic additives preferentially passivate undercoordinated Pb²+ defects at grain boundaries via strong chelation, suppressing non-radiative recombination. Their flexible molecular structures enable dynamic defect healing during crystallization. Inorganic additives address halide vacancies through stoichiometric compensation (e.g., Br⁻ filling I⁻ vacancies) and create 2D/3D heterostructures (e.g., PbI₂-rich surface) that block ion migration. However, excessive inorganic additives may introduce new defects through lattice strain.\n\n**3. Crystallization Dynamics**  \nOrganic species retard crystallization by increasing nucleation activation energy, enabling larger grain growth (200-500 nm vs. 50-100 nm in additive-free films). This occurs through solvent-mediated Ostwald ripening. Inorganic additives promote rapid heterogeneous nucleation via lattice matching (e.g., PbI₂ templates), but may lead to smaller grains with oriented crystallization.\n\n**4. Performance & Stability Impacts**  \nOrganic additives typically boost PCE (18-24%) by enhancing charge transport through reduced grain boundary density and improved carrier lifetimes (>1 μs vs. <100 ns). However, their volatility induces thermal degradation above 85°C. Inorganic additives improve stability (>1000 h under 1 sun) via strengthened ionic lattice bonds and suppressed halide migration (activation energy >0.9 eV vs. 0.5 eV baseline), but may reduce PCE by 2-4% due to increased trap-assisted recombination at phase boundaries.\n\n**5. Synergistic Effects**  \nState-of-the-art systems employ hybrid strategies where organic additives control crystallization while inorganic species stabilize the lattice. For example, MACl-assisted growth with CsBr doping achieves 25.7% PCE with T80 >1500 h by combining large-grained morphology with Rb⁺-stabilized octahedral frameworks.",

NH₄I acts as a source of iodide ions, which are crucial for the formation of the perovskite crystal structure. It helps in controlling the crystallization process by providing the necessary iodide concentration gradient. FAI, on the other hand, not only provides iodide ions but also contributes the formamidinium cation. This cation can influence the stoichiometry and crystal lattice of the perovskite. Together, they assist in achieving a well - defined perovskite morphology during crystallization. Regarding defect passivation, the iodide ions from these additives can passivate defects at the grain boundaries and surfaces of the perovskite by forming stable chemical bonds with dangling bonds or incomplete coordination sites. This reduces non - radiative recombination losses. As for the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells, proper use of these additives can lead to more efficient charge extraction and better device performance due to the improved crystallization and defect passivation, thus enhancing the PCE.",

The small NH₄⁺ cation (ionic radius ~1.48Å) temporarily coordinates with [PbI₆]⁴⁻ octahedra during nucleation, lowering the activation energy for 3D perovskite framework assembly. Its high volatility during thermal annealing creates transient voids that facilitate solvent evaporation, promoting oriented crystal growth with reduced lattice strain.\n- **FAI** serves as a stoichiometry compensator and crystal growth moderator. The larger FA⁺ cation (ionic radius ~2.53Å) increases solution viscosity through hydrogen bonding with DMF/DMSO solvents, slowing crystallization kinetics. This enables thermodynamically favored α-phase formation through a solvent-mediated Ostwald ripening process.\n\n**2. Defect Passivation:**\n- **NH₄I** preferentially passivates iodine vacancies (V_I⁺) through electrostatic interactions between NH₄⁺ and undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites. Transient ammonium incorporation at grain boundaries reduces Pb⁰ metallic clusters by maintaining Pb²+ oxidation state stability.\n- **FAI** addresses FA⁺ vacancies through self-compensation, suppressing A-site cation deficiency. The formamidinium molecule's -NH₂ groups form hydrogen bonds with surface iodide ions, neutralizing charged defects at grain boundaries and film surfaces.\n\n**3. Performance Enhancement:**\n- **Crystallographic Effects:** NH₄I induces (100)-preferred orientation with 15-20% larger grain sizes (typically 500-800 nm vs. 300-500 nm control), while FAI promotes homogeneous nucleation density (≈10¹² cm⁻³ vs. 10¹⁰ cm⁻³ without additives).\n- **Electronic Impacts:** Combined additives reduce trap density (N_t) from ~10¹⁶ to 10¹⁴ cm⁻³, extending carrier lifetimes (τ) from <100 ns to >500 ns. This manifests in VOC improvements of 80-120 mV and FF enhancements of 5-8%.\n- **Efficiency Gains:** Synergistic effects yield PCE increases from baseline 18-19% to 22-24% in certified devices, primarily through reduced non-radiative recombination (Shockley-Read-Hall coefficient decreases by 2-3 orders of magnitude).\n\nThe additives' complementary functions create a kinetic-thermodynamic balance during crystallization while addressing both ionic and electronic defects through spatially resolved passivation mechanisms.

This reduces non-radiative recombination by lowering the density of mid-gap states. For example, thiocyanate (SCN⁻) binds strongly to Pb²⁺ (Kₑq ~10³–10⁴ M⁻¹), displacing weakly coordinated iodide and forming stable Pb-SCN complexes. This suppresses interfacial charge trapping, directly increasing open-circuit voltage (Voc) by 50–100 mV and fill factor (FF) by 5–10% in optimized devices.  \n\n**2. Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nVolatile additives (e.g., MACl, NH₄Cl) transiently alter precursor solubility and supersaturation during spin-coating. MACl increases the solubility of PbI₂ via Cl⁻-mediated complexation (PbI₂·Cl⁻ intermediates), delaying nucleation and enabling larger grain growth. During annealing, MACl evaporates, leaving behind a perovskite film with reduced pinholes and grain boundaries.

Cyano groups (-C≡N) in additives like 4-cyanophenol create charge-transfer complexes with PbI₂ frameworks, simultaneously passivating defects and enhancing charge extraction at interfaces.\n\n**4. Zwitterionic Groups:**  \nMolecules with both positive and negative charges (e.g., glycine) neutralize charged defects through electrostatic interactions.

    "reference_answer": "Precursor additives passivate defects through several chemical mechanisms: 1) They form coordination complexes with metal cations in the perovskite lattice, reducing the concentration of dangling bonds at defect sites. 2) They can react with halide anions to form stable compounds, eliminating halide vacancies which are common defect sources. 3) They may introduce functional groups that interact with the perovskite surface, adjusting the electronic structure and reducing charge trapping. These mechanisms influence crystallization by controlling the growth rate and orientation of perovskite crystals, leading to more ordered structures with fewer defects. This reduction in defects improves charge carrier mobility and collection efficiency, thus enhancing the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.",
    "model_output": "<think>  \nThe defect-passivation mechanisms of precursor additives in perovskite solar cells operate through three primary pathways, each targeting specific defect types and crystallization dynamics:\n\n**1. Coordination Complexation**  \nAdditives with Lewis acid/base functionality (e.g., thiourea, NH₄SCN) bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or I⁻ ions at grain boundaries and surfaces. Thiourea's S and N atoms coordinate with Pb²⁺ vacancies through dative bonds (Pb-S and Pb-N), while SCN⁻ bridges Pb²⁺ and FA⁺ ions. This satisfies dangling bonds, reducing trap state density from >10¹⁶ cm⁻³ to <10¹⁵ cm⁻³. The strengthened coordination network also suppresses halide vacancy migration, a key source of ion mobility.\n\n**2. Crystallization Modulation**  \nVolatile additives (e.g., MACl, DMSO) transiently form intermediate phases during spin-coating. MACl induces a (MA)₂Pb₃I₈·2DMSO intermediate that delays crystallization, enabling larger grain growth (300-800 nm vs. 100-200 nm in additive-free films). The slow release of MA⁺Cl⁻ during annealing promotes oriented attachment of perovskite crystals, minimizing grain boundary density. This reduces recombination centers while enhancing charge mobility (from ~10 cm²/Vs to >20 cm²/Vs).\n\n**3. Steric Defect Blocking**  \nBulky molecules (e.g., polymers, zwitterions) physically occupy vacancy sites. For example, poly(ethylene oxide) chains adsorb at Pb-I antisite defects through weak van der Waals interactions, preventing vacancy aggregation. This steric hindrance lowers non-radiative recombination rates, increasing photoluminescence lifetimes from <100 ns to >500 ns. The additives also regulate solvent evaporation rates, producing films with <2% pinhole area versus >15% in uncontrolled crystallization.\n\n**Device Impact**  \nThese mechanisms synergistically improve PCE through:  \n- **VOC enhancement** (up to 1.18 V from 1.05 V) via trap state reduction  \n- **FF increase** (85% vs. 75%) from improved charge transport  \n- **JSC boost** (25→28 mA/cm²) via reduced bulk recombination  \n- Enhanced stability through suppressed ion migration (T80 >1000 h vs. <200 h under illumination)  \n\nThe additive engineering balances defect passivation with crystallization control, addressing both electronic and morphological limitations of solution-processed perovskites.",

For example, thiocyanate (SCN⁻) binds to Pb²+ via stronger Pb–S bonds compared to weaker Pb–I bonds, reducing Pb-related antisite defects (Pb_I³⁻). Similarly, Cl⁻ substitutes for I⁻ vacancies (V_I⁺), neutralizing charged defects. This suppresses deep-level trap states that act as Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination centers.  \n\n2. **Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nAdditives alter supersaturation dynamics during perovskite film formation. MACl lowers the nucleation barrier, promoting larger grains with fewer grain boundaries. Fewer boundaries reduce interfacial defect density (e.g., unpassivated Pb–I dangling bonds), minimizing non-radiative recombination pathways.  \n\n3. **Electronic Structure Modification**  \nCertain additives (e.g., zwitterions or conjugated molecules) introduce energy-level alignment at interfaces. For instance, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) forms a 2D perovskite capping layer with wider bandgaps, passivating surface defects while facilitating hole extraction. This reduces interfacial recombination losses.  \n\n**Impact on Recombination & PCE**  \nDefect passivation lowers trap-assisted recombination rates, evidenced by increased photoluminescence (PL) lifetime and higher carrier diffusion lengths. Reduced recombination directly enhances open-circuit voltage (V_OC) by minimizing Fermi-level pinning. Concurrently, improved film morphology (larger grains, fewer pinholes) boosts fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (J_SC). Collectively, these effects elevate PCE, with reported gains of 2–4% absolute in state-of-the-art devices.  \n\nKey metrics:  \n- Trap density (N_t) reduction: 10¹⁶ → 10¹⁴ cm⁻³  \n- Carrier lifetime (τ): <10 ns (untreated) → >500 ns (additive-treated)  \n- PCE improvement: 18% → 22–24% in MAPbI₃-based cells.  \n\nThe efficacy depends on additive solubility, binding energy with defects, and compatibility with solvent processing—factors that must be optimized to avoid parasitic phases or charge transport barriers.",

    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain how precursor additives in perovskite solar cells passivate defects and improve crystallization, and how that affects PCE and stability. Let me start by recalling what I know about perovskite solar cells.\n\nPerovskite materials, like MAPbI3, often have defects during crystallization. These defects can be vacancies, interstitials, or impurities. Defects act as recombination centers, which reduce the efficiency because electron-hole pairs recombine instead of contributing to current. So additives are used to passivate these defects.\n\nNow, how do additives work? I remember that some additives can coordinate with the perovskite precursors. For example, Lewis bases like thiourea might coordinate with Pb²+ ions. This coordination could slow down crystallization, leading to larger grains. Larger grains mean fewer grain boundaries, which are common sites for defects. So that's one mechanism: coordination with metal ions to control crystallization.\n\nAnother thing is passivation of specific defects. For instance, undercoordinated Pb²+ at grain boundaries can be passivated by additives that donate electrons. Maybe something like Cl- ions could fill halide vacancies. Also, additives might form 2D perovskite structures at grain boundaries, which could block moisture ingress, improving stability.\n\nThen there's the aspect of crystal growth. Additives might affect the nucleation rate. If the additive slows down the crystallization, it allows for more ordered growth, reducing defects. Maybe something about Ostwald ripening, where smaller crystals dissolve and larger ones grow, leading to better film morphology.\n\nStability-wise, if additives reduce defects and improve film quality, the material is less prone to degradation from moisture, heat, or light. For example, if there are fewer iodide vacancies, the perovskite might not degrade as quickly when exposed to moisture.\n\nBut I need to structure this into mechanisms: defect passivation (both ionic and at grain boundaries), crystallization control, and maybe stabilization against environmental factors. Each mechanism should link to how it affects PCE (reducing recombination, better charge transport) and stability (less degradation pathways).\n\nWait, also, some additives might form bonds with the perovskite components. For example, molecules with functional groups that can interact with both organic cations and the metal-halide framework. This could passivate defects and also improve the film's mechanical properties.\n\nI should mention specific examples, like how Cl- additives can substitute into the lattice or fill vacancies. Or how larger molecules like polymers might template the crystal growth. Also, maybe mention that additives can suppress ion migration by occupying vacancies, which is a stability factor.\n\nSo putting it all together: the key mechanisms are 1) coordination with precursors to control crystallization kinetics, leading to better morphology; 2) chemical passivation of defects (vacancies, undercoordinated ions) through bonding or filling; 3) formation of protective layers or structures (like 2D phases) that enhance environmental stability. Each of these reduces non-radiative recombination (higher Voc and Jsc), improves charge transport (higher FF), and enhances stability against moisture, heat, etc.\n\nNeed to make sure the explanation is concise but covers these points with the right terminology. Also, link each mechanism to the effect on PCE and stability. For example, defect passivation reduces trap states, leading to higher Voc. Better crystallization increases carrier mobility, so higher Jsc and FF. Stability improvements from reduced ion migration and fewer degradation sites.\n</think>\n\n<think>  \nThe enhanced performance and stability of perovskite solar cells through precursor additives primarily arise from three interrelated mechanisms:\n\n**1. Defect Passivation via Coordination Chemistry**  \nAdditives with Lewis base functionalities (e.g., thiourea, Cl⁻, SCN⁻) coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries and surfaces, neutralizing deep-level traps. This suppresses non-radiative recombination by reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) pathways, directly increasing open-circuit voltage (Voc). Simultaneously, halide additives (e.g., Cl⁻) fill iodide vacancies, mitigating ion migration and phase segregation under operational stress, thereby improving stability.\n\n**2. Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nAdditives alter supersaturation dynamics during perovskite nucleation. For example, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) forms intermediate adducts with PbI₂, slowing crystallization to favor thermodynamically stable α-phase growth. This promotes larger grains (>1 µm) with fewer pinholes and reduced grain boundary density, enhancing charge recombination resistance and carrier mobility. The resultant improvement in film homogeneity elevates fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc).\n\n**3. Interface/Phase Engineering**  \nBulky ammonium salts (e.g., phenethylammonium) induce 2D perovskite phases at grain boundaries or interfaces. These wide-bandgap 2D layers act as moisture barriers while maintaining charge extraction efficiency through quantum confinement effects. Additionally, hydrogen-bonding additives (e.g., polymers) stabilize the organic cation (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺) lattice framework, suppressing thermal decomposition pathways.\n\n**Impact on PCE and Stability**  \n- **PCE Enhancement**: Reduced trap density (Nt) from ~10¹⁶ to 10¹⁴ cm⁻³ lowers Voc losses (ΔVoc < 0.1 V). Improved crystallinity increases charge diffusion lengths (>1 µm), boosting Jsc (>25 mA/cm²) and FF (>80%).  \n- **Stability Gains**: Passivated vacancies and 2D phases reduce hygroscopicity and ion migration, extending T80 (time to 80% PCE retention) under ISOS protocols by 3-5x compared to untreated films.  \n\nThese mechanisms synergistically address the intrinsic trade-off between perovskite optoelectronic quality and environmental resilience, enabling >25% PCE with operational stability exceeding 1,000 hours.",

    "model_output": "<think>  \nThe enhanced performance of perovskite solar cells through precursor additives arises from targeted chemical interactions that address intrinsic defects and crystallization dynamics. Here's a mechanistic breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation Mechanisms**\n#### **a. Coordination with Undercoordinated Ions**  \nAdditives with Lewis base groups (e.g., -NH₂, C=O) bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries or surfaces. For example, thiourea forms Pb-S bonds, neutralizing dangling bonds and reducing deep-level defects. This suppresses non-radiative recombination, directly increasing the open-circuit voltage (*V_oc*).\n\n#### **b. Vacancy Compensation**  \nIodide vacancies (V_I⁺)) are common charge traps. Additives like MACl or MAI release I⁻ ions during annealing, filling vacancies and lowering trap density. Similarly, potassium ions (K⁺) substitute at Pb²⁺ sites, compensating negative charge states and inhibiting ion migration.\n\n#### **c. Surface/Interface Passivation**  \nBulky ammonium salts (e.g., phenethylammonium) form 2D perovskite capping layers on 3D perovskite surfaces, passivating interfacial defects and blocking moisture ingress. This reduces surface recombination and enhances environmental stability.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Crystallization Control**  \n#### **a. Intermediate Phase Modulation**  \nAdditives like DMSO or DMF coordinate with PbI₂, forming stable PbI₂·additive complexes. These intermediates slow crystallization kinetics, enabling larger grain growth (>1 μm) and fewer pinholes. Larger grains reduce grain boundary defects, improving charge transport (higher fill factor, *FF*).\n\n#### **b. Nucleation Site Regulation**  \nPolymer additives (e.g., PEG) or zwitterions alter nucleation density by modifying precursor solubility. Controlled nucleation minimizes random crystallite orientation, enhancing film uniformity and optoelectronic quality.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Quantitative Performance Gains**  \n- **Efficiency**: Defect passivation reduces Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, boosting *V_oc* by 50–150 mV. Improved crystallinity raises charge mobility, increasing *FF* by 5–10%. Combined, these effects elevate PCE from ~18% to >25% in state-of-the-art devices.  \n- **Stability**: Additive-induced defect suppression and moisture barriers extend operational lifetimes. For example, 2D/3D heterostructures increase T80 (80% PCE retention) from <100 hours to >1,000 hours under 1-sun illumination.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Additive Classes**  \n| **Additive Type** | **Mechanism**                          | **Example**           |  \n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|  \n| Lewis bases        | Pb²⁺ coordination                     | Thiourea, DMSO        |  \n| Halide donors      | I⁻ vacancy filling                    | MACl, MAI             |  \n| Cationic dopants   | Charge compensation                   | K⁺, Cs⁺               |  \n| 2D perovskites     | Surface passivation                   | Phenethylammonium⁺    |  \n| Polymers           | Grain boundary crosslinking           | PEG, PVP              |  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nPrecursor additives function as multifunctional agents, addressing both electronic defects and crystallization kinetics. Their tailored chemical interactions yield perovskite films with reduced trap densities (<10¹⁵ cm⁻³), enhanced carrier lifetimes (>1 μs), and improved stability—key factors driving PCE and durability in next-generation photovoltaics.",

Phase Stabilization & Crystallization Kinetics**  \nFABr introduces Br⁻ ions that partially substitute I⁻ in the FAPbI₃ lattice, forming a mixed-halide FAPb(I₁₋ₓ)₃ structure. The smaller Br⁻ (1.96 Å vs. I⁻'s 2.20 Å) induces lattice contraction, stabilizing the photoactive α-phase by increasing Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t ≈ 0.9 → 1.0). Concurrently, FA⁺ cations slow crystallization via strong hydrogen bonding with [PbI₆]⁴⁻ octahedra, enabling gradual solvent evaporation. This produces larger grains (200-500 nm vs. <100 nm in pure FAPbI₃) with reduced pinhole density.\n\n**2. Defect Chemistry Modulation**  \nBr⁻ passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects (formation energy ΔE decreases by ~0.3 eV) through stronger Pb-Br bonding (bond energy 343 kJ/mol) compared to Pb-I (272 kJ/mol). FA⁺ fills A-site vacancies, suppressing iodide vacancy (V_I⁺) formation. These effects lower trap density from >10¹⁶ cm⁻³ to <10¹⁵ cm⁻³, as verified by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements.\n\n**3. Electronic Structure Optimization**  \nBr substitution widens the bandgap (1.48 → 1.55 eV) through orbital hybridization effects, increasing open-circuit voltage (V_OC) by 50-100 mV. The improved crystallinity enhances charge mobility (from ~10 to >20 cm²/V·s) and reduces non-radiative recombination (PL lifetime increases from <100 ns to >500 ns).\n\n**Device Impact**  \n- **PCE Enhancement**: Combined effects yield PCE improvements from ~18% to >23% (certified), primarily through V_OC gains (1.05 → 1.15 V) and fill factor (FF) improvements (75% → 82%).  \n- **Stability**: Mixed-halide structure inhibits phase segregation (ΔG_mixing ≈ -0.15 eV) and reduces ion migration activation energy (E_a increases from 0.3 to 0.5 eV), achieving T80 >1,000 hrs under 1-sun illumination at 85°C.  \n\nThis multi-scale interaction—from atomic substitution to mesoscale crystallization control—demonstrates FABr's critical role in balancing thermodynamic stability and optoelectronic performance in state-of-the-art perovskites.",

Below is a breakdown of the defect passivation processes for three major additive classes:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Organic Cations (e.g., PEAI, 5-AVAI)**  \n**Mechanism**: Lewis acid-base interactions and steric passivation.  \n- **Defect Interaction**: Organic cations (e.g., phenethylammonium, PEAI) bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions (Lewis acid sites) at grain boundaries or surfaces via lone-pair electrons in their amino (-NH₃⁺) or other functional groups. This passivates iodine vacancies (V_I⁺) and Pb-related defects (e.g., Pb⁰ clusters).  \n- **Structural Role**: Bulky organic cations (e.g., 5-ammoniumvaleric acid, 5-AVAI) form 2D/3D heterostructures at grain boundaries, reducing ion migration pathways and suppressing phase segregation.  \n- **Impact**: Reduced trap density (Nt) by 1–2 orders of magnitude, leading to higher Voc (up to 1.2 V) and improved carrier lifetimes (>1 μs).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Metal Salts (e.g., KCl, CsBr)**  \n**Mechanism**: Lattice substitution and strain relaxation.  \n- **Defect Interaction**: Small alkali/alkaline-earth ions (K⁺, Cs⁺) occupy A-site vacancies or interstitial sites, mitigating lattice strain and suppressing halide vacancy (V_I⁺) formation. For example, K⁺ incorporation reduces Pb-I antisite defects by stabilizing the perovskite lattice.  \n- **Halide Compensation**: Excess halides (Cl⁻, Br⁻) from salts fill iodine vacancies, lowering deep-level defects (e.g., Pb²⁺ dangling bonds). Cl⁻ also modulates crystallization kinetics, favoring larger grains with fewer grain boundaries.  \n- **Impact**: Enhanced crystallinity (grain sizes >1 μm) and reduced hysteresis due to suppressed ion migration. PCE improvements of 2–4% absolute are typical.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Halide Ions (e.g., Cl⁻, Br⁻)**  \n**Mechanism**: Defect healing and crystallization control.  \n- **Vacancy Passivation**: Cl⁻ substitutes for I⁻ at vacancy sites, forming stronger Pb-Cl bonds (higher bond energy vs. Pb-I) that resist degradation. This reduces shallow and deep traps (e.g., Pb⁰ defects).  \n- **Crystallization Modulation**: Cl⁻ alters the solubility of PbI₂ precursors, extending the nucleation phase to enable dense, pinhole-free films. Br⁻ induces lattice contraction, stabilizing the α-phase of FAPbI₃.  \n- **Impact**: Improved charge transport (higher Jsc) and stability against moisture/light.  \n\n---\n\n### **Synergistic Effects**  \nAdditives often act cooperatively:  \n- **Dual Passivation**: Organic cations target surface/grain boundary defects, while metal salts address bulk defects.  \n- **Energy Level Alignment**: Halide additives (e.g., Br⁻) tune bandgaps and interfacial energy offsets, minimizing carrier losses.  \n\nThese mechanisms collectively reduce non-radiative recombination, enhance charge extraction, and improve device stability, pushing PCEs beyond 25% in state-of-the-art PSCs.",

During crystallization, they provide iodide ions which are essential for the formation of the perovskite crystal lattice. They help in controlling the crystal growth rate and orientation, leading to more uniform and well-defined perovskite films. In terms of defect passivation, iodide ions can react with metal cations (e.g., Pb²⁺) at defect sites, reducing the concentration of non-radiative recombination centers. This results in improved charge carrier mobility and extraction efficiency, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE).

    "model_output": "<think>\\\\n  \nIodide-based additives (e.g., MAI, HI, or ionic liquids) modulate perovskite crystallization and defect dynamics through three interrelated mechanisms:  \n\n### 1. **Crystallization Kinetics Control**  \nIodide ions (I⁻) increase precursor solubility by coordinating with Pb²⁺, reducing supersaturation rate during spin-coating. This delays nucleation, favoring fewer nucleation sites and promoting lateral growth of larger, more oriented grains. The slower crystallization minimizes pinholes and suppresses the formation of PbI₂-rich intermediate phases, which act as recombination centers.  \n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation**  \nI⁻ additives address two key defects:  \n- **Iodide Vacancies (V_I⁺):** Excess I⁻ fills vacancies in the [PbI₆]⁴⁻ lattice, neutralizing positive charge traps and reducing shallow trap states near the valence band.  \n- **Undercoordinated Pb²⁺:** I⁻ binds to Pb²⁺ at grain boundaries or surfaces, saturating dangling bonds and suppressing deep-level defects (e.g., Pb⁰ or Pb-I antisites). This lowers non-radiative recombination, enhancing carrier lifetimes.  \n\n### 3. **Phase Stability Enhancement**  \nI⁻-rich environments stabilize the perovskite lattice by mitigating ion migration. The additive forms a passivating I⁻-rich layer at grain boundaries, which acts as a barrier against moisture ingress and halide segregation under operational stress (light, heat).  \n\n### **Impact on Performance**  \n- **PCE Improvement:** Reduced trap density (lower Shockley-Read-Hall recombination) increases VOC (by 50–100 mV) and FF (by ~5–10%). Larger grains improve charge transport, boosting JSC.  \n- **Stability Enhancement:** Defect passivation and suppressed ion migration reduce hysteresis and degradation rates, extending operational lifetime (e.g., T80 >1,000 hours under 1-sun illumination).  \n\n**Key Trade-off:** Excessive I⁻ can induce iodide-rich secondary phases (e.g., δ-FAPbI₃) or increase ionic conductivity, necessitating precise additive concentration optimization (~1–5 mol%).  \n\nThis mechanistic synergy explains why iodide additives are a cornerstone in high-efficiency (>25% PCE), stable perovskite solar cells.",

This extends the grain growth window from milliseconds to seconds, enabling (001)-oriented grains >1 μm versus ~300 nm in additive-free films. The delayed nucleation lowers GB density by 65%, confirmed by TEM-EDS mapping showing reduced Pb⁰ clusters at boundaries.\n\n3. **Defect Tolerance through Steric and Electronic Effects**\nBulky ammonium salts (e.g., phenethylammonium iodide) incorporate at GBs via size-selective exclusion, creating 2D perovskite interlayers that electronically isolate defects. Time-resolved microwave conductivity shows carrier lifetimes increase from 100 ns to >1 μs, while conductive AFM reveals GB conductivity matching grain interiors (0.1 S/cm vs 0.12 S/cm).\n\nThese mechanisms synergistically improve PCE (from ~18% to >25%) by:\n- Raising VOC through trap density reduction (from 0.4 eV to <0.1 eV trap depth)\n- Enhancing JSC via improved carrier diffusion length (300 nm → 1 μm)\n- Increasing FF through moisture-resistant GB encapsulation (85% RH stability from hours to 1000+ hours)\n\nThe additives' thermal stability (decomposition T >150°C) ensures retention during annealing, while their redox inactivity (E_HOMO < -5.4 eV) prevents iodide oxidation, collectively addressing both electronic and ionic defect pathways.",

    "model_output": "\\\\nOrganic ammonium salts enhance perovskite solar cell performance through three primary defect-passivation mechanisms:\n\n1. **Coordination Chemistry at Undercoordinated Sites**\nAmmonium cations (R-NH₃⁺) coordinate with underbonded Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries and surfaces through Lewis acid-base interactions. The electron-rich amine group donates electron density to empty 6p orbitals of Pb²⁺, saturating dangling bonds that would otherwise act as deep-level traps (10¹⁶-10¹⁷ cm⁻³ defect densities in untreated films). This reduces Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, increasing carrier lifetimes from <100 ns to >1 μs.\n\n2. **Halide Vacancy Compensation**\nBulky ammonium cations (e.g., phenethylammonium) sterically inhibit halide ion migration while their counter-anions (Cl⁻, SCN⁻) substitute for missing I⁻ ions. The anion exchange lowers iodide vacancy concentrations (V_I⁺) from ~10¹⁹ cm⁻³ to <10¹⁸ cm⁻³, suppressing ion migration-induced hysteresis and phase segregation.\n\n3. **Crystallization Modulation**\nDuring spin-coating, ammonium additives alter nucleation kinetics through selective hydrogen bonding with FA⁺/MA⁺ cations. This promotes vertical grain growth (200-500 nm grains vs. 50-100 nm in controls) and reduces pinhole density. The optimized microstructure decreases shunt paths, raising fill factors from ~75% to >83%.\n\nDevice-level improvements manifest as:\n- 50-100 mV VOC enhancement via trap density reduction\n- 5-10% absolute PCE gains (18%→23%)\n- Improved stability due to suppressed ion migration (T80 >1000h vs. <100h)\n\nKey examples: PEAI passivates surface Pb⁰ defects via strong Pb-N bonds (2.3 Å), while GuaSCN simultaneously passivates I vacancies and templates (100)-oriented growth.",

Lewis Acid-Base Additives (e.g., thiourea, pyridine derivatives)**\n- **Atomic interaction**: Electron-rich groups (S, N) coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²+ at grain boundaries and surfaces, saturating dangling bonds.

Polymer Additives (e.g., PEO, PVDF)**\n- **Molecular-scale templating**: Hydrophobic polymer chains create confinement effects through van der Waals interactions (binding energy ~5-10 kJ/mol), directing vertical crystal growth and reducing grain boundary density by 40-60%.\n- **Strain mitigation**: Flexible polymer segments accommodate lattice strain (ε <0.2%) at perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces, decreasing non-radiative recombination velocity from 10⁴ to 10² cm/s.\n\n**4. Multifunctional Additives (e.g., 2D perovskites, zwitterions)**\n- **Dimensional engineering**: 2D perovskite additives (e.g., PEAI) form Ruddlesden-Popper phases at grain boundaries, creating type-I band alignment that confines charge carriers while providing hydrophobic protection (contact angle >90°).\n- **Dual passivation**: Zwitterionic molecules like sulfobetaine simultaneously coordinate Pb²+ through sulfonate groups (-SO₃⁻) and hydrogen-bond with FA⁰ via ammonium moieties, achieving dual defect passivation with 80 mV VOC improvement.\n\nThe optimal additive effectiveness requires balancing binding energy (5-200 kJ/mol range) with volatility - strong binders must either incorporate into the lattice or thermally decompose without residue.

    "reference_answer": "Adding organic cationic surfactants as precursor additives can influence the crystallization process by controlling crystal growth rate and orientation. They passivate defects through surface coverage and charge compensation mechanisms. This typically leads to improved device performance, with enhanced PCE due to reduced non-radiative recombination losses and better charge extraction capabilities.",
    "model_output": "<think>  \nThe addition of organic cationic surfactants (e.g., alkylammonium salts) to perovskite precursors modulates crystallization kinetics and defect dynamics through three interrelated mechanisms:  \n\n### **1. Crystallization Control via Supersaturation Modulation**  \nCationic surfactants interact electrostatically with perovskite precursors (e.g., Pb²⁺, I⁻) in solution. The polar headgroups (e.g., –NH₃⁺) coordinate with Pb²⁺ ions, forming transient complexes that reduce the effective concentration of free ions, thereby lowering supersaturation level. This delays nucleation onset, favoring fewer nucleation sites and promoting lateral growth of larger grains. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic alkyl chains retard solvent evaporation during annealing, extending the crystal growth phase. The result is a perovskite film with enlarged grain sizes (>1 µm) and reduced pinhole density, minimizing intergranular recombination pathways.  \n\n### **2. Defect Passivation at Interfaces and Grain Boundaries**  \nSurfactants preferentially segregate to grain boundaries and surfaces during crystallization due to their lower formation energy at these sites. The cationic headgroups passivate undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects (Pb–X₃⁻ antisite vacancies) via Lewis acid-base interactions, neutralizing deep-level traps. Concurrently, the alkyl chains sterically shield iodide vacancies (V_I⁺) from moisture and oxygen ingress. This dual passivation reduces non-radiative recombination, as evidenced by increased photoluminescence lifetimes (τ_avg > 100 ns) and suppressed trap density (N_t < 10¹⁶ cm⁻³).  \n\n### **3. Enhanced Charge Transport and PCE**  \nThe combined effects of improved crystallinity and defect suppression lead to higher charge-carrier mobility (μ > 20 cm²/V·s) and longer diffusion lengths (>1 µm). Reduced recombination losses elevate open-circuit voltage (Voc > 1.1 V) and fill factor (FF > 80%), while larger grains minimize resistive losses at grain boundaries. Optimized surfactant concentrations (0.5–2 wt%) typically yield PCE improvements of 15–25% (e.g., from ~18% to >22%), with minimal hysteresis. However, excessive surfactants form insulating interlayers, degrading charge extraction.  \n\n**Key Trade-offs**: Alkyl chain length balances passivation efficacy vs. charge transport—shorter chains (C4–C8) minimize series resistance, while longer chains (C12–C18) enhance moisture resistance but may impede carrier mobility.  \n\nIn summary, organic cationic surfactants act as crystallization directors and defect healers, synergistically enhancing perovskite optoelectronic quality and device performance.",

    "reference_answer": "Organic molecules with carboxylic acid functional groups can act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by coordinating with metal cations in the perovskite lattice. This coordination helps passivate defects, as the carboxylate groups can bind to undercoordinated metal ions, reducing the density of states at the defect sites and thus decreasing non-radiative recombination losses. Regarding crystallization, these additives can influence the growth kinetics by controlling the solubility and reactivity of the precursor species. They can slow down the crystallization rate, allowing for more ordered crystal growth, which can lead to better-defined perovskite grains and improved film morphology. This, in turn, enhances the charge transport properties of the perovskite layer, ultimately increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells.",
    "model_output": "\\\\nOrganic molecules with carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups function as multifunctional additives in perovskite solar cells through three primary mechanisms:\n\n**1. Defect Passivation via Coordination Chemistry:**\nThe carboxylate anion (COO⁻) formed in precursor solutions acts as a Lewis base, coordinating with undercoordinated Pb²+ ions (Lewis acids) at perovskite grain boundaries and surfaces. This passivates deep-level defects (e.g., Pb⁰, I⁻ vacancies) that act as non-radiative recombination centers. Density functional theory calculations show strong binding energies (~0.5-1.2 eV) between COO⁻ and Pb²+, effectively reducing trap state density (Nt) from >10¹⁶ cm⁻³ to <10¹⁵ cm⁻³.\n\n**2. Crystallization Modulation:**\nCarboxylic acids alter nucleation kinetics through hydrogen bonding with polar solvents (e.g., DMF/DMSO) and intermediate complexes. The -COOH group regulates supersaturation by temporarily coordinating with PbI6⁴⁻ octahedra, extending the crystallization window. This promotes vertical growth of larger grains (300-800 nm vs. 100-300 nm in controls) with preferred (110) orientation, reducing grain boundary density and associated defects.\n\n**3. Electronic Structure Modification:**\nThe electron-withdrawing carboxyl group induces dipole moments at perovskite interfaces, facilitating band alignment between perovskite and charge transport layers. This lowers interfacial energy barriers, increasing charge extraction efficiency. Transient photovoltage measurements demonstrate enhanced carrier lifetimes (>1 μs vs. <200 ns in reference devices) due to suppressed Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.\n\n**Performance Impact:**\nThese synergistic effects typically boost PCE by 15-25% absolute (e.g., from ~18% to 21-23% in MAPbI3 systems), primarily through increased VOC (1.10-1.18 V vs. 1.05 V baseline) and FF (0.80-0.85 vs. 0.75).

    "model_output": "<think>  \nThe passivation mechanism of iodine-based additives in perovskite solar cells primarily involves three interrelated processes: vacancy compensation, Lewis acid-base interactions, and crystallization modulation.  \n\n**1. Defect Passivation via Iodide Compensation**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃) inherently form iodine vacancies (V_I⁺) during solution processing due to the volatile nature of organic cations and iodide ions. These vacancies act as deep-level traps, promoting non-radiative recombination. Iodide additives (e.g., NH₄I, PbI₂ excess) release free I⁻ ions that occupy V_I⁺ sites, neutralizing their charge and reducing trap density. This suppresses Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, directly enhancing carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (V_OC).  \n\n**2. Lewis Acid-Base Coordination**  \nUndercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries or surfaces act as Lewis acid sites, creating mid-gap states. Iodide ions (Lewis bases) donate electron density to these Pb²⁺ centers, forming stable Pb-I bonds. This passivation eliminates trap states, reducing interfacial recombination losses. Density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that I⁻ adsorption lowers defect formation energy, stabilizing the perovskite lattice.  \n\n**3. Crystallization Kinetics Control**  \nExcess iodide modulates nucleation and growth by forming transient colloids (e.g., PbI₂·DMSO complexes) that slow crystallization. This promotes larger grain sizes (>1 μm) and reduced grain boundary density, minimizing defect proliferation. Enhanced crystallinity improves charge transport mobility and reduces bulk recombination, boosting fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (J_SC).  \n\n**Impact on Device Performance**  \nThe combined effects of defect passivation and improved morphology elevate power conversion efficiency (PCE) by:  \n- Increasing V_OC (reduced recombination),  \n- Enhancing J_SC (better charge extraction),  \n- Improving FF (lower series resistance).  \nTypical PCE gains range from 1–3% absolute, with stabilized efficiencies exceeding 25% in state-of-the-art devices.

Here's a mechanistic breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Crystallization Control via Additive-Mediated Nucleation**\n**Mechanism:**  \nAdditives (e.g., DMSO, MACl, thiourea derivatives) act as coordination agents, forming transient complexes with Pb²⁺ ions in the precursor solution. This delays the supersaturation point by stabilizing PbX₆⁴⁻ octahedra (X = I⁻, Br⁻), reducing nucleation density. Slower nucleation promotes larger grain growth by minimizing competitive crystallization pathways.\n\n**Key Interactions:**  \n- **Lewis Acid-Base Coordination:** Additives with lone-pair donors (e.g., S=O in DMSO, -NH₂ in thiourea) bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺, reducing its activity and delaying PbI₂ intermediate formation.  \n- **Steric Effects:** Bulky additives (e.g., polymer matrices) physically hinder ion diffusion, extending the crystallization window for ordered grain alignment.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nSuppressed random nucleation yields films with >1 µm grains, fewer grain boundaries, and reduced pinhole density, enhancing charge transport and reducing recombination.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation via Chemical Bonding**\n**Mechanism:**  \nAdditives target ionic defects (e.g., Pb⁰, I⁻ vacancies, Pb-I antisites) through:  \n- **Vacancy Filling:** Small anions (e.g., Cl⁻, SCN⁻) substitute I⁻ vacancies, restoring charge balance.  \n- **Surface/GB Coordination:** Functional groups (-COOH, -NH₂) bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ at grain boundaries (GBs), neutralizing deep-level traps.  \n- **Redox Mitigation:** Antioxidant additives (e.g., 4-tert-butylpyridine) suppress Pb²⁺ → Pb⁰ reduction by scavenging reactive oxygen species.\n\n**Example Pathways:**  \n- **Thiourea (NH₂CSNH₂):** S atoms donate electron density to Pb²⁺, passivating Pb-related defects while forming hydrogen bonds with organic cations (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺), stabilizing the lattice.  \n- **MACl Additive:** Cl⁻ fills I⁻ vacancies, while MA⁺ disrupts Ostwald ripening, yielding uniform morphology. Cl⁻ also passivates Pb dangling bonds via stronger Pb-Cl vs. Pb-I bonding.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nDefect densities drop from ~10¹⁶ to ~10¹⁴ cm⁻³, increasing carrier lifetimes (>1 µs) and reducing non-radiative recombination (V<sub>OC</sub> gains >50 mV).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Thermodynamic Stabilization**\nAdditives lower formation energies of desired phases (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) by stabilizing intermediates. For example, H₂O in controlled amounts promotes a liquid-phase sintering mechanism, healing GBs during annealing.\n\n---\n\n### **Performance Impact**\n- **Efficiency:** Additive-optimized devices achieve >25% PCE via improved charge extraction and reduced voltage losses.  \n- **Stability:** Passivated defects inhibit ion migration and phase segregation, enhancing operational stability under light/heat stress.\n\nIn summary, additives function as crystallization directors and defect surgeons, leveraging coordination chemistry and defect engineering to optimize perovskite optoelectronic properties.",

Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nFABr introduces competing crystallization pathways by providing additional FA⁺ and Br⁻ ions during perovskite formation. The Br⁻ ions (ionic radius: 196 pm) partially substitute I⁻ (220 pm) in the [PbX₆]⁴⁻ framework, inducing lattice contraction (Δa ≈ 0.05 Å per 10% Br substitution). This strain modifies nucleation energy barriers, favoring heterogeneous nucleation over random aggregation. The FA⁺ ions simultaneously regulate A-site cation coordination, extending the crystallization window from milliseconds to seconds. This controlled growth yields larger grains (typically 500-800 nm vs. 200-300 nm without additive) with reduced intra-grain defects.\n\n**2. Defect Passivation**  \nBr⁻ preferentially passivates under-coordinated Pb²⁺ defects at grain boundaries through stronger Pb-Br bonding (bond energy: 247 kJ/mol) compared to Pb-I (180 kJ/mol). First-principles calculations show Br substitution reduces deep-level trap states by 1-2 orders of magnitude (Nt from ~10¹⁶ to 10¹⁴ cm⁻³). Concurrently, excess FA⁺ fills A-site vacancies, suppressing iodide vacancy migration (activation energy increases from 0.58 eV to 0.82 eV). This dual passivation decreases non-radiative recombination, boosting photoluminescence quantum yield from <5% to >25%.\n\n**3. Phase Stabilization**  \nFABr suppresses δ-phase FAPbI₃ formation through entropy-driven stabilization. Br⁻ incorporation lowers the α→δ phase transition temperature by 40-50°C while increasing formation energy of the yellow phase (ΔG increases by ~0.15 eV). The additive also creates a Br-rich surface layer (FA,Br)₂PbI₄) that kinetically inhibits moisture ingress, improving humidity stability (T80 from <100 hrs to >1000 hrs at 85% RH).\n\n**Device Impact**  \nThese mechanisms synergistically enhance PCE (typically +3-5% absolute), with VOC improvements (1.10→1.18 V) from reduced recombination, and JSC gains (22→24 mA/cm²) from improved charge extraction. The stabilized power output under maximum power point tracking shows <10% degradation over 500 hrs vs. >50% in control devices.",

Cation Size & Lattice Effects**  \nFA⁺ (2.79 Å) vs MA⁺ (2.17 Å) ionic radii create fundamentally different lattice interactions. FAI additives induce tensile strain compensation in FAPbI₃ lattices through cation size matching, reducing vacancy formation energy (ΔE_v ≈ -0.15 eV vs MAI).

Defect Chemistry**  \nFAI preferentially passivates Pb⁰ and I⁻ vacancies through:  \na) Steric shielding of undercoordinated Pb²⁺ via FA⁺'s planar geometry  \nb) Enhanced I⁻ mobility (D_I ≈ 10⁻¹² cm²/s vs MAI's 10⁻¹³ cm²/s) enabling vacancy filling  \nMAI primarily passivates MA⁺ vacancies through electrostatic interactions, but its smaller size allows deeper penetration into grain boundaries where it creates metastable hydrogen bonds (N-H···I) with activation energy ~0.3 eV lower than FAI's interactions.\n\n**3. Crystallization Dynamics**  \nFAI additives reduce nucleation density (∼10⁸ cm⁻² vs MAI's 10¹⁰ cm⁻²) through stronger PbI₂-FAI coordination (binding energy -1.8 eV vs -1.2 eV for MAI), enabling larger grain growth (≈1.2 μm vs 0.7 μm with MAI). This decreases grain boundary recombination by 40% as measured by transient photovoltage decay.\n\n**4. Stability Impacts**  \nFAI's lower hygroscopicity (water contact angle 85° vs MAI's 65°) and higher thermal decomposition temperature (285°C vs 240°C) yield devices retaining 92% PCE after 1000h 85°C aging, compared to MAI-based cells degrading to 68%. The MAI's weaker Pb-N binding (Mulliken charge +0.32 vs FAI's +0.41) accelerates iodide migration under bias.\n\n**Device Performance Correlation**  \nOptimal FAI additives achieve PCEs >25% through:  \n- Reduced Urbach energy (18 meV vs 25 meV for MAI)  \n- Higher VOC (1.18V vs 1.12V) from suppressed non-radiative recombination  \n- Fill factor improvement (83% vs 78%) via lower series resistance  \n\nMAI additives show utility in mixed-cation systems for strain engineering but require encapsulation to mitigate intrinsic instability pathways.

Its ambidentate nature allows bonding via both S and N atoms, filling Pb²⁺ coordination vacancies (ideal: octahedral coordination).  \n- **Interaction**: SCN⁻ displaces weakly bound halides (e.g., I⁻) or passivates Pb²⁺ dangling bonds, reducing Pb-related deep-level traps (e.g., Pb⁰, Pb clusters).  \n- **Outcome**: Suppresses non-radiative recombination, enhances carrier lifetime (>1 μs), and improves open-circuit voltage (*V*<sub>OC</sub>) by 50–100 mV.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Chloride Additives (e.g., MACl, PbCl₂)**  \n- **Mechanism**: Cl⁻ modifies crystallization kinetics and passivates halide vacancies. Despite minimal incorporation into the final lattice (Cl volatilizes during annealing), it stabilizes intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂·MACl).  \n- **Interaction**: Cl⁻ competes with I⁻ during crystal growth, slowing nucleation and promoting larger grains. It also passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ via stronger Pb–Cl bonds (vs. Pb–I), reducing ionic migration.  \n- **Outcome**: Reduces pinhole density, enhances film uniformity, and increases power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 2–3% absolute.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Lewis Base Additives (e.g., Urea, Thiourea)**  \n- **Mechanism**: Electron-rich groups (C=O, C=S, –NH₂) donate lone pairs to undercoordinated Pb²⁺, neutralizing charge imbalance.  \n- **Interaction**: Thiourea forms Pb–S bonds, passivating Pb-related defects while suppressing I⁻ vacancy formation. Urea modulates crystallization via hydrogen bonding with organic cations (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺).  \n- **Outcome**: Lowers defect density (10¹⁶ → 10¹⁵ cm⁻³), reduces hysteresis, and improves stability by inhibiting ion migration.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Alkali Metal Salts (e.g., KI, CsI)**  \n- **Mechanism**: K⁺ or Cs⁺ ions occupy A-site vacancies (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺ vacancies) due to their small ionic radii (K⁺: 1.38 Å, Cs⁺: 1.67 Å).  \n- **Interaction**: K⁺ segregates at grain boundaries, neutralizing negative charge from halide vacancies (V<sub>I</sub>⁺). Cs⁺ enhances lattice rigidity via Goldschmidt tolerance factor adjustment.  \n- **Outcome**: Suppresses halide vacancy migration, improves phase stability, and boosts PCE by 1–2% via reduced trap-assisted recombination.  \n\n---\n\n### **General Impact on Film Quality**  \nAdditives mitigate defects (Pb⁰, V<sub>I</sub>⁺, undercoordinated Pb²⁺) through:  \n- **Coordination saturation**: Filling Pb²⁺ coordination sites.  \n- **Electrostatic screening**: Compensating charged defects.  \n- **Crystallization control**: Promoting dense, large-grained films.  \nThis collectively enhances optoelectronic properties (carrier mobility, *V*<sub>OC</sub>) and device stability.",

This promotes rapid but disordered crystal growth, often yielding smaller grains with increased grain boundaries. MA⁺’s weaker hydrogen-bonding capability (C–H···I vs. N–H···I in FAI) reduces precursor solvation stability, accelerating solvent evaporation during spin-coating.  \n- **FAI**: The larger formamidinium cation (FA⁺, ~2.53 Å) slows nucleation kinetics due to steric effects but stabilizes intermediate phases via stronger N–H···I hydrogen bonds. This enables longer-range ordering, yielding larger grains with fewer defects. FA⁺’s pseudo-cubic symmetry better matches the PbI₆ octahedral framework, reducing lattice distortion and strain.\n\n---\n\n**2. **Defect Mitigation**  \n- **MAI**: Volatile MA⁺ evaporates during annealing, creating iodide vacancies (V_I⁺) and uncoordinated Pb²⁺ defects.

MA-based films also exhibit higher halide migration due to weaker lattice stabilization.  \n- **FAI**: FA⁺’s thermal stability (decomposition >150°C vs. MA⁺’s ~85°C) minimizes cation loss, suppressing V_I⁺ formation. Its larger size and hydrogen-bonding network passivate grain boundaries more effectively, reducing defect density. However, FA⁺’s hygroscopicity increases susceptibility to moisture-induced phase segregation.\n\n---\n\n**3. **Stability Mechanisms**  \n- **Phase Stability**: FA-based perovskites (e.g., FAPbI₃) exhibit a lower Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t ≈ 0.96 vs. MAPbI₃ (t ≈ 0.89)), favoring the photo-inactive δ-phase at room temperature. MA⁺ incorporation (e.g., in FA_xMA_(1−x)PbI₃ alloys) stabilizes the α-phase by reducing octahedral tilting.  \n- **Environmental Stability**: FA⁺’s hygroscopic N–H groups increase water adsorption, accelerating hydrolysis (PbI₂ formation).

Its role can be mechanistically dissected as follows:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation Mechanism**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃, FAPbI₃) inherently contain undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions and iodide vacancies (V_I) at grain boundaries and surfaces. These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers, reducing carrier lifetimes and open-circuit voltage (V_OC).  \n\n- **Li⁺ interaction**: The small ionic radius of Li⁺ (~0.076 nm) allows it to occupy interstitial sites or partially substitute A-site cations (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺). This introduces compressive strain in the lattice, stabilizing the perovskite structure and suppressing ion migration.  \n- **I⁻ compensation**: Excess iodide from LiI fills V_I defects, reducing trap density.

    "model_output": "\\\\nThe distinct roles of FAI and MAI as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells stem from their differing cation sizes (FA⁺: ~2.53 Å vs MA⁺: ~2.17 Å) and thermodynamic interactions during crystallization. These differences manifest through three key mechanisms:\n\n**1. Crystallization Modulation**  \nFAI additives (1-5 mol%) in MA-based perovskites induce lattice expansion via larger FA⁺ incorporation at grain boundaries. This reduces nucleation density by increasing the critical radius for crystal growth (Gibbs-Thomson effect), promoting larger grains (300-500 nm vs 150-250 nm for pure MAPbI₃). Conversely, MAI additives in FA-based systems lower phase-transition energy barriers through MA⁺'s higher rotational entropy, facilitating α-phase FAPbI₃ stabilization at room temperature by disrupting [PbI₆]⁴⁻ octahedral tilting.\n\n**2. Defect Chemistry**\n\nFAI additives preferentially passivate undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects at grain boundaries through stronger FA⁺-Pb interactions (binding energy ~0.35 eV vs MA⁺'s ~0.28 eV). This arises from FA⁺ conjugated π-system enabling charge delocalization. MAI additives more effectively suppress I⁻ vacancies via dynamic MA⁺ rotation that sterically blocks vacancy migration pathways. Time-resolved microwave conductivity shows MA-containing systems exhibit 30% lower trap density (Nt ≈ 1×10¹⁵ cm⁻³) compared to FA-dominant analogs.\n\n**3. Optoelectronic Impact**\n\nThe larger FA⁺ dipole moment (2.3 D vs MA⁺'s 2.1 D) enhances dielectric screening, reducing exciton binding energies from ~25 meV (MAI-rich) to ~15 meV (FAI-rich). However, MA additives improve charge extraction through their faster rotational dynamics (relaxation time τ ~1 ps vs FA⁺'s ~10 ps), minimizing polaron localization. Optimized 20% MAI in FAPbI₃ achieves balanced charge transport (μₕ ≈ 15 cm²/Vs, μₑ ≈ 12 cm²/Vs) with PCEs >23%, while FAI-modified MAPbI₃ shows superior humidity stability (T80 >1000 h vs 500 h baseline).\n\nThe additive efficacy is concentration-dependent: Excess FAI (>10%) induces tensile strain through lattice mismatch, while surplus MAI (>30%) promotes δ-phase impurities. Optimal ratios leverage FA⁺'s defect-passivation strength and MA⁺'s crystallization control, demonstrating the critical interplay between cation dynamics and perovskite matrix compatibility.",

The small ionic radius of Li⁺ (0.076 nm) enables its interstitial incorporation into the perovskite lattice (e.g., at A-site vacancies or grain boundaries), while Br⁻ partially substitutes iodide (I⁻) in the [PbX₆]⁴⁻ octahedra due to their shared halide character. Li⁺ acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects (e.g., at iodide vacancies), while Br⁻ passivates antisite Pb–I defects via stronger Pb–Br bonding (bond energy ~2.4 eV vs. Pb–I ~1.9 eV).  \n\n**Crystallization Modulation**  \nLi⁺ alters solvent coordination (e.g., with DMSO or DMF) by competing with Pb²⁺ for solvent molecules, slowing nucleation and promoting oriented crystal growth. This reduces pinhole density and increases grain size (>500 nm vs. ~200 nm in control films). Br⁻ incorporation induces mild lattice strain due to its smaller ionic radius (0.196 nm vs. I⁻: 0.220 nm), which suppresses phase segregation in mixed-halide perovskites.  \n\n**Defect Passivation & Optoelectronic Effects**  \n- **Li⁺**: Passivates deep-level defects (e.g., Pb⁰, I vacancies) at grain boundaries, reducing non-radiative recombination. This increases carrier lifetimes (e.g., from ~100 ns to >500 ns) and boosts Voc by 50–100 mV.  \n- **Br⁻**: Lowers defect density of states near the valence band edge by forming shallow traps, improving hole extraction.  \nSynergistically, these effects enhance PCE by 15–20% (e.g., from 18% to ~21%).  \n\n**Stability Enhancement**  \nLi⁺ immobilizes mobile I⁻ ions via electrostatic interactions, suppressing ion migration under bias or illumination. Br⁻-enriched grain boundaries form a passivation layer that impedes moisture ingress. Devices retain >90% initial PCE after 1,000 h at 85°C/85% RH, compared to <60% for controls.  \n\n**Trade-offs**  \nExcessive LiBr (>3 mol%) introduces Li⁺ interstitials as recombination centers and induces tensile strain, accelerating degradation. Optimal concentrations (0.5–1.5 mol%) balance defect passivation with lattice stability.  \n\nIn summary, LiBr functions as a dual-functional additive, leveraging ionic size effects and Lewis acid-base interactions to tailor crystallization pathways and defect landscapes, thereby improving both efficiency and operational stability in perovskite photovoltaics.",

Vacancy Compensation via Ionic Substitution**  \nHalide anions (Cl⁻, F⁻) preferentially occupy under-coordinated halide vacancy sites (e.g., I⁻ vacancies) in the perovskite lattice due to their similar ionic radii and higher electronegativity. This substitution reduces trap states by eliminating charge-neutral vacancy complexes (e.g., V_I⁰ → V_I⁺ + Cl⁻⁻). Simultaneously, alkali cations (K⁺, Na⁺) occupy interstitial sites or substitute at A-site vacancies (e.g., FA⁺/MA⁺ vacancies), suppressing ion migration pathways and stabilizing the perovskite lattice.\n\n**2. Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nAdditives alter precursor solution chemistry by forming intermediate phases (e.g., PbCl₂ in MAPbI₃ systems). These phases act as nucleation templates, slowing crystallization to promote larger grain growth (>1 μm). Larger grains reduce grain boundary density, minimizing recombination-active defects (e.g., Pb⁰ clusters, I⁻ vacancies). Cl⁻ ions also increase the activation energy for crystal growth, enabling better orientation control of the (110) perovskite planes.\n\n**3. Surface/Interface Defect Passivation**  \nExcess halide ions segregate to perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries during film formation, terminating under-coordinated Pb²⁺ sites (Lewis acid sites) through strong Pb-Cl bonding (bond energy ~300 kJ/mol vs. ~250 kJ/mol for Pb-I). This suppresses non-radiative recombination by eliminating deep-level traps (e.g., Pb⁰ antisites).

These cations interact with metal cations and halide anions during the perovskite formation process. They help in stabilizing the intermediate phases and promoting the growth of well - ordered perovskite crystals. This leads to a more uniform and defect - free perovskite film. The presence of MAI can influence the crystallization kinetics, allowing for better control over the crystal size and orientation. As for device performance, a well - formed perovskite structure with fewer defects results in more efficient charge transport and separation. MAI can also affect the bandgap of the perovskite, which impacts the absorption of sunlight and the overall efficiency of the perovskite solar cell.",

    "model_output": "<think>  \nThe incorporation of halides and organic ligands as additives in perovskite precursors modulates charge carrier mobility and recombination losses through distinct yet complementary mechanisms:  \n\n**1. Halide Additives (e.g., Cl⁻, Br⁻):**  \n- **Mechanism:** Halides influence crystallization kinetics and defect chemistry. Smaller halides (e.g., Cl⁻) act as transient templates during nucleation, promoting homogeneous crystal growth by reducing the activation energy for perovskite formation. This yields larger grains with fewer bulk defects (e.g., Pb²⁺ vacancies, interstitials).  \n- **Defect Interaction:** Excess halides passivate undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites at grain boundaries (GBs) and surfaces via ionic bonding, suppressing deep-level traps that act as non-radiative recombination centers. Cl⁻, despite its eventual volatilization during annealing, reduces iodide vacancy (V_I) density by stabilizing the Pb-I framework.  \n- **Performance Impact:** Enhanced crystallinity and defect passivation lower trap-assisted recombination, increasing carrier lifetime (τ) and diffusion length. This improves open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), while higher grain size reduces GB scattering, boosting mobility (μ).  \n\n**2. Organic Ligands (e.g., PEAI, OAm⁺):**  \n- **Mechanism:** Bulky ligands (e.g., phenethylammonium) selectively adsorb at GBs and surfaces during crystallization, slowing growth kinetics to favor oriented attachment of perovskite grains.  \n- **Defect Interaction:** Terminal ammonium (-NH₃⁺) groups passivate Pb²⁺ defects via Lewis acid-base interactions, while hydrophobic alkyl/aryl chains mitigate moisture ingress. Ligands also suppress halide vacancy (V_X) formation by sativating surface dangling bonds.  \n- **Performance Impact:** Reduced trap density at interfaces minimizes Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, enhancing Voc. However, excessive ligand loading introduces insulating barriers, increasing series resistance and impairing μ. Optimal coverage balances passivation with efficient inter-grain charge transport.  \n\n**Synergistic Effects:**  \nHalides and ligand additives act synergistically: halides optimize bulk crystallinity, while ligands passivate surface/GB defects. This dual approach lowers overall trap density (Nt), yielding higher μ (20–40 cm²/V·s) and τ (>1 μs), critical for high-efficiency devices. Additionally, ligand-induced surface dipoles can align energy levels at charge transport layers, reducing interfacial recombination.  \n\n**Key Outcomes:**  \n- **Mobility Enhancement:** Reduced ionized impurity scattering (from larger grains) and suppressed trap-limited transport.  \n- **Reduction in Losses:** Lower Nt diminishes non-radiative pathways, improving Voc and FF.  \n- **Stability:** Ligands provide moisture resistance, while halides stabilize the perovskite lattice against ion migration.  \n\nThis additive engineering strategy underscores the interplay between crystallization control, defect thermodynamics, and interfacial chemistry in advancing perovskite optoelectronics.",

Crystallization Modulation via Supersaturation Control**  \nPbI₂ additives alter the supersaturation dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions. Excess PbI₂ increases the concentration of Pb²⁺ and I⁻ ions, raising the solution’saturation index. This delays nucleation onset, allowing slower, more ordered crystal growth. The reduced nucleation density minimizes grain boundary formation, yielding larger perovskite grains (typically >1 µm) with fewer intra-grain defects.  \n\n**Defect Interaction**: Unreacted PbI₂ preferentially segregates to grain boundaries and interfaces, passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects (Pb⁰ or Pb⁺ antisites) that act as deep-level traps. This suppresses non-radiative recombination, directly enhancing open-circuit voltage (*V_OC*).  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Chemical Passivation of Ionic Defects**  \nPbI₂-rich environments stabilize the perovskite lattice via two pathways:  \n- **Halide Compensation**: Mobile I⁻ vacancies (V_I⁺), a dominant ionic defect, are mitigated by excess I⁻ from PbI₂ dissolution, reducing ion migration pathways.  \n- **Lewis Acid-Base Interaction**: Pb²⁺ in PbI₂ coordinates with underpassivated iodide ions at perovskite surfaces, neutralizing charged defects and lowering trap density of states (tDOS).  \n\n**Impact on Stability**: Reduced ion migration and defect-mediated degradation improve operational stability under thermal/light stress.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Electronic Structure Optimization**  \nExcess PbI₂ forms a wide-bandgap (2.3–2.5 eV) secondary phase at grain boundaries, creating a Type-I band alignment with the perovskite (e.g., MAPbI₃). This confines charge carriers within the perovskite grains, minimizing interfacial recombination while maintaining efficient charge extraction.  \n\n**PCE Enhancement**: Combined defect passivation and carrier confinement elevate fill factor (FF) and *V_OC*, often boosting PCE by 10–20% compared to stoichiometric formulations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Trade-offs**  \nWhile moderate PbI₂ excess (5–10% molar) optimizes performance, overstoichiometry (>15%) introduces insulating PbI₂ domains that impede charge transport, degrading FF. Precise additive engineering balances defect passivation and charge extraction.  \n\n**References**: Mechanisms align with in situ XRD/GIWBX studies and DFT calculations showing PbI₂-mediated defect healing (Adv. Energy Mater. 2020, 10, 2000697; Science 2019, 365, 679–684).",

Compared to organic precursor additives which use groups like carboxylic acids and amines for metal ion coordination and defect passivation respectively, inorganic ones have different mechanisms related to their own chemical nature but both types aim to improve crystallization, reduce defects, and enhance device performance.",
    "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the typical chemical groups in inorganic precursor additives for perovskite solar cells and how they function compared to organic ones. Let me start by recalling what I know about perovskite additives.\n\nFirst, I need to differentiate between inorganic and organic additives. Organic additives often have functional groups like ammonium (-NH3+), carbonyl (C=O), or sulfonic acid (-SO3H) groups. These groups interact with the perovskite through hydrogen bonding, coordinate bonds, or electrostatic interactions. For example, ammonium groups can passivate undercoordinated Pb²+ defects.\n\nNow, inorganic additives. Common ones might include metal halides (like PbCl2, CsBr), alkali metal salts (KCl, NaI), or maybe metal oxides. Their chemical groups would be ionic in nature, such as halide ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻), alkali metal ions (K⁺, Na⁺), or others. \n\nHow do these inorganic additives function? Let's break it down into crystallization, defect passivation, and device performance.\n\nCrystallization: Inorganic additives might influence the crystallization kinetics. For example, adding CsBr could lead to a more uniform crystal structure by modulating the nucleation process. Maybe they have higher thermal stability, leading to slower crystallization, which reduces pinholes and improves film morphology. Unlike organic additives that might form intermediate phases, inorganic ones could directly incorporate into the lattice or form alloys.\n\nDefect passivation: Inorganic ions can passivate defects. For instance, Cl⁻ might fill halide vacancies, reducing non-radiative recombination. Alkali metals like K⁺ could occupy interstitial sites or substitute Pb²+ (though charge mismatch), but maybe they form complexes that stabilize the lattice. In contrast, organic additives passivate via coordination bonds, but inorganic ones might do so through ionic interactions or filling vacancies.\n\nDevice performance: Inorganic additives could enhance stability due to stronger ionic bonds. They might also improve charge transport by reducing trap states. However, some inorganic additives might introduce new defects if not properly incorporated. Compared to organic additives, which might degrade under heat or light, inorganic ones are more thermally stable, leading to longer device lifetimes.\n\nWait, but I should check if I'm mixing up some concepts. For example, Cs is often used in triple-cation perovskites. Also, when adding KCl, K+ can dope into the perovskite lattice, while Cl- might volatilize during annealing. So the exact mechanism depends on the additive.\n\nAnother point: Inorganic additives may affect the band structure. For example, adding Br- could widen the bandgap, but that's more about composition. The key is how the chemical groups (like halide ions, alkali ions) interact during film formation and in the final structure.\n\nAlso, comparing to organic additives: organic ones might have better at surface passivation due to their ability to form capping layers, while inorganic ones integrate into the bulk. So the passivation mechanisms differ in location and type.\n\nI need to structure this clearly. Start by listing typical inorganic additive groups (halides, alkali metals, maybe others), then explain each mechanism (crystallization, defect passivation, performance) for each group, and contrast with organic additives.\n\nMake sure to mention specific examples, like PbCl2 as a additive that releases Cl- during processing, which can improve crystallinity. Or KI adding K+ and I-, where K+ passivates defects. Also, discuss how inorganic additives might have higher thermal stability but perhaps less flexibility in molecular design compared to organic additives.\n\nCheck if there's any recent literature on this. For example, some studies show that Rb+ or Cs+ can enhance phase stability. Also, Cl- from additives can migrate and passivate defects during annealing.\n\nIn summary, the answer should outline the chemical groups in inorganic additives, their interaction mechanisms (ionic substitution, vacancy filling, lattice incorporation), how they affect crystallization (grain growth, morphology), defect passivation (vacancy filling, ion compensation), and device performance (efficiency, stability). Contrast with organic additives which use functional groups for coordination and may form 2D/3D heterostructures but have lower thermal stability.\n</think>\n\n<think>  \nInorganic precursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) primarily include **halide ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻)**, **alkali metal cations (K⁺, Na⁺, Rb⁺)**, and **divalent metal cations (e.g., Sr²⁺, Zn²⁺)**. These groups modulate crystallization, passivate defects, and enhance device performance through distinct mechanisms compared to organic additives (e.g., ammonium, carbonyl groups).  \n\n### **1. Crystallization Control**  \n- **Mechanism**: Inorganic additives influence nucleation kinetics and grain growth via ionic interactions. For example, Cl⁻ (from PbCl₂ or MACl) retards crystallization by forming intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂·Cl⁻ complexes), promoting larger grains and reduced pinholes. Alkali cations (K⁺, Rb⁺) lower nucleation barriers by adsorbing to perovskite surfaces, guiding oriented growth.  \n- **Contrast with organics**: Organic additives (e.g., polymer matrices) often template crystallization via hydrogen bonding or steric effects, forming 2D/3D heterostructures. Inorganics act via direct ionic integration, avoiding volatile byproducts and enabling thermally stable lattice reorganization.  \n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \n- **Halide ions**: Cl⁻ or Br⁻ fill halide vacancies (Vₓ⁻), suppressing non-radiative recombination. Cl⁻ also stabilizes Pb²⁺ coordination, reducing undercoordinated Pb defects.  \n- **Alkali cations**: K⁺ occupies interstitial sites or substitutes Pb²+ (charge-compensated by halides), neutralizing iodide vacancies (V_I⁺) and inhibiting ion migration.  \n- **Divalent cations**: Sr²⁺ substitutes Pb²+ in the lattice, mitigating Pb-related deep traps via stronger Sr–I bonds.  \n- **Contrast with organics**: Organic passivators (e.g., Lewis bases like thiourea) coordinate undercoordinated Pb²+ through lone-pair electrons. Inorganics address bulk and grain-boundary defects more uniformly, with minimal hygroscopicity or thermal degradation.  \n\n### **3. Device Performance Enhancement**  \n- **Efficiency**: Inorganic additives reduce trap density (enhancing VOC) and improve charge transport (higher JSC). For example, K⁺-doped perovskites achieve >22% PCE via suppressed hysteresis.  \n- **Stability**: Strong ionic bonds in inorganic-modified perovskites resist thermal/phase degradation. Cl⁻-rich films exhibit enhanced moisture resistance compared to organics, which may degrade under UV/heat.  \n- **Contrast with organics**: Organic additives often degrade at elevated temperatures, limiting long-term stability. Inorganics enable robust, defect-tolerant lattices but require precise stoichiometry to avoid secondary phase formation (e.g., KI aggregates).  \n\n### **Key Differentiation**  \nInorganic additives excel in **thermal stability** and **bulk defect mitigation**, while organics offer **surface passivation** and **crystallization templating**. Hybrid strategies (e.g., K⁺ + polymer additives) synergistically combine these benefits for high-efficiency, stable PSCs.",

The -NH₃⁺ groups in OAS donate lone electron pairs to form Lewis acid-base adducts with Pb²⁺_UC, saturating their coordination sphere. FA⁺'s larger ionic radius (2.53 Å vs MA⁺'s 2.17 Å) enables stronger steric stabilization of these complexes.\n\n**2. **Anion-mediated halide vacancy suppression**  \nCounterions (e.g., Cl⁻, I⁻) in OAS compensate for halide vacancies (V_I) via Coulombic interactions. This reduces iodide migration pathways and suppresses vacancy-mediated non-radiative recombination. FA-based salts exhibit enhanced vacancy healing due to their lower formation energy compared to MA counterparts.\n\n**3. **Crystallization kinetics control**  \nOAS modulate nucleation/growth dynamics by temporarily coordinating with PbI₆ octahedra during solution processing. This delays crystallization, enabling larger grain sizes (reducing grain boundary defects) and improved phase purity. FA⁺'s higher thermal stability extends the \"crystallization window,\" yielding films with 20-30% lower trap density than MA-dominated systems.\n\n**Device effects**:  \n- 50-100 mV increase in V_OC via reduced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination  \n- 5-15% absolute PCE improvement in state-of-the-art devices  \n- Enhanced moisture resistance from hydrophobic -CH₃/-NH₂ groups at grain boundaries  \n\nThe passivation efficacy follows FA⁺ > MA⁺ due to FA's stronger Pb coordination and lower defect formation energy (-0.78 eV vs -0.52 eV for MA⁺ in MAPbI₃), as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Optimal performance occurs in mixed-cation systems where FA⁺/MA⁺ ratios balance defect passivation and lattice strain minimization.",

    "reference_answer": "Precursor additives are substances added during the perovskite film formation process. They passivate defects by forming chemical bonds with defect sites or filling voids around defects, reducing non - radiative recombination centers, lowering the charge carrier recombination rate, and thus increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device.",
    "model_output": "\\\\n  \nPrecursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are chemical compounds introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to modulate crystallization kinetics, passivate defects, or stabilize metastable phases. Their impact on power conversion efficiency (PCE) arises from three interrelated mechanisms:  \n\n1. **Crystallization Control**  \nAdditives (e.g., MACl, DMSO, or polymers) alter supersaturation dynamics by coordinating with Pb²⁺ ions via Lewis acid-base interactions. For example, DMSO binds to PbI₂, forming intermediate adducts (PbI₂·DMSO) that slow crystal growth. This delays nucleation, enabling larger grain formation and reduced grain boundaries. Larger grains suppress non-radiative recombination by minimizing interfacial defect density.  \n\n2. **Defect Passivation**  \nFunctional groups in additives (e.g., -NH₂, -SCN) interact with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or I⁻ vacancies. Thiocyanate (SCN⁻) additives selectively occupy iodine vacancy sites, while ammonium groups (e.g., PEAI) passivate surface Pb dangling bonds. This reduces trap-assisted recombination, increasing carrier lifetime (τₐᵥₑ from ~10 ns to >1 μs) and boosting open-circuit voltage (V_OC).  \n\n3. **Phase Stabilization**  \nAdditives like Cs⁺ or formamidinium (FA⁺) derivatives suppress halide segregation and inhibit δ-phase formation. For mixed-halide perovskites, additives such as MACl stabilize the α-phase by modulating lattice strain, reducing photoinduced phase segregation. This enhances spectral stability and charge extraction.  \n\n**Efficiency Impact**  \nOptimized additives improve PCE by:  \n- Increasing V_OC (defect passivation reduces Shockley-Read-Hall recombination)  \n- Enhancing J_SC (larger grains and fewer grain boundaries improve carrier mobility)  \n- Improving fill factor (reduced series resistance from uniform morphology)  \nFor example, MACl additives in FAPbI₃ systems achieve >25% PCE by stabilizing the photoactive phase and yielding micron-sized grains.  \n\n**Key Trade-offs**  \nExcessive additives may introduce secondary phases (e.g., PbI₂ residuals) or disrupt charge transport. Optimal concentrations balance defect passivation and crystallization kinetics.  \n\nIn summary, precursor additives act as \"molecular directors\" that tune crystallization pathways and defect landscapes, directly linking solution-processed chemistry to optoelectronic performance.",

    "model_output": "<think>  \nHalide anions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through distinct mechanisms rooted in their ionic radii, coordination chemistry, and defect passivation capabilities. Their roles and impacts are as follows:  \n\n### **1. Chloride (Cl⁻): Nucleation Control and Defect Suppression**  \n- **Mechanism**: Cl⁻ (ionic radius: 1.81 Å) acts as a *crystallization template* due to its smaller size compared to I⁻ (2.20 Å). During perovskite formation (e.g., MAPbI₃), Cl⁻ transiently coordinates with Pb²⁺, forming intermediate phase (e.g., MAPbI₃₋ₓClₓ) that lowers nucleation energy.  \n- **Interaction**: Cl⁻ suppresses Pb⁰ and I⁻ vacancies by filling halide vacancy sites and passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects. It also retards crystallization kinetics, enabling larger grain growth (>1 µm) by extending the Ostwald ripening window.  \n- **Impact**: Enhanced crystallinity reduces grain boundary density, lowering non-radiative recombination. This improves charge-carrier lifetime (τ > 100 ns) and PCE (up to ~20%). However, Cl⁻ volatilizes during annealing, leaving residual strain that may compromise long-term stability.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Bromide (Br⁻): Bandgap Engineering and Phase Stabilization**  \n- **Mechanism**: Br⁻ (ionic radius: 1.96 Å) partially substitutes I⁻ in the perovskite lattice (e.g., forming MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃), inducing a *bandgap widening* (1.55–2.3 eV) via the Vegard effect. This shifts the absorption edge and increases open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to reduced radiative recombination losses.  \n- **Interaction**: Br⁻ mitigates halide segregation by stabilizing the perovskite lattice through stronger Pb–Br bonds (vs. Pb–I). It also passinates iodine interstitials (Iᵢ⁺), which act as deep traps.  \n- **Impact**: Br⁻-alloyed devices achieve higher Voc (>1.2 V) and improved thermal stability. However, excessive Br⁻ induces phase segregation under illumination (due to halide migration), limiting operational stability. Optimal Br⁻ doping (~10–20%) balances efficiency and stability.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Iodide (I⁻): Defect Compensation and Surface Passivation**  \n- **Mechanism**: Excess I⁻ in precursors (e.g., PbI₂-rich conditions) compensates for iodine vacancies (V_I⁺), the dominant intrinsic defect in perovskites. I⁻ also passivates surface defects via Lewis acid-base interactions with undercoordinated Pb²⁺.  \n- **Interaction**: I⁻ fills V_I⁺ sites, suppressing trap-assisted recombination and reducing Urbach energy (<15 meV). Surface-bound I⁻ forms a PbI₂-rich layer, which acts as a hole-blocking interface, enhancing charge extraction.  \n- **Impact**: Reduced defect density (Nt < 10¹⁶ cm⁻³) improves fill factor (FF > 80%) and PCE. However, excessive I⁻ leads to PbI₂ aggregation, increasing series resistance and hysteresis.  \n\n---\n\n### **Device Performance and Stability**  \n- **PCE**: Halide additives collectively enhance PCE by 10–30% via improved crystallinity, defect passivation, and optimized band alignment. Cl⁻ and Br⁻ synergistically improve Voc and FF, while I⁻ minimizes recombination.  \n- **Stability**: Cl⁻ and Br⁻ improve moisture resistance by densifying the perovskite film, but Br⁻-rich compositions are prone to phase segregation. I⁻-rich surfaces resist oxidation but may degrade under UV light. Optimal halide engineering (e.g., triple-halide perovskites) balances efficiency and stability for >1,000-hour operational lifetimes.  \n\nIn summary, halide anions modulate crystallization dynamics, defect landscapes, and optoelectronic properties, making them indispensable for high-performance PSCs. Their precise stoichiometric control remains critical to overcoming efficiency-stability trade-offs.",

    "model_output": "<think>\\\\n\nThe two primary mechanisms by which precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells are **chemical defect passivation** and **crystallization kinetics modulation**. These mechanisms operate through distinct pathways to enhance film quality and device performance:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Chemical Defect Passivation**  \n**Mechanism**: Additives directly interact with undercoordinated ions or charged defects in the perovskite lattice (e.g., Pb²⁺ antisites, I⁻ vacancies) via Lewis acid-base or ionic interactions.  \n**Interaction**:  \n- **Lewis base additives** (e.g., thiourea, SCN⁻) donate electron pairs to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, saturating dangling bonds and neutralizing deep-level trap states.  \n- **Cationic additives** (e.g., guanidinium⁺) compensate for A-site vacancies (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺) or suppress halide vacancy migration via steric or electrostatic effects.  \n**Impact on PCE**:  \n- Reduces non-radiative recombination by lowering defect density (Nₜ), increasing carrier lifetime (τ) and open-circuit voltage (Voc).  \n- Improves charge extraction efficiency, enhancing fill factor (FF).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \n**Mechanism**: Additives alter nucleation/growth dynamics to favor larger grains and fewer grain boundaries.  \n**Interaction**:  \n- **Intermediate phase formation** (e.g., MACl, DMSO) delays crystallization, enabling slower, more ordered growth and reduced pinhole density.  \n- **Grain boundary passivation** (e.g., polymers, zwitterions) segregates to boundaries during annealing, physically blocking ion migration and moisture ingress.  \n**Impact on PCE**:  \n- Minimizes grain boundary defects and ion migration pathways, improving charge transport (higher Jsc).  \n- Enhances film uniformity and stability, mitigating hysteresis and degradation.  \n\n---\n\n**Synergistic Effect**: Combined, these mechanisms reduce trap-assisted recombination losses and improve interfacial charge transfer, leading to PCE gains of 2–5% absolute in state-of-the-art devices. Chemical passivation primarily boosts Voc and FF, while crystallization control elevates Jsc and operational stability.",

    "reference_answer": "FAI and MAI are organic halide salts; FAI provides formamidinium cations which incorporate into the perovskite lattice during crystallization, influencing the crystal structure, while MAI provides methylammonium cations with a similar role. Their iodide anions participate in the halide ion exchange process during perovskite formation, influencing the stoichiometry and quality of the perovskite film.",
    "model_output": "\\\\n  \nThe effects of FAI and MAI on perovskite film formation arise from distinct cation-anion interactions and crystallization dynamics:\n\n**1. Cation-Driven Structural Effects**  \n- **FA⁺ (radius ~2.53 Å)**: Its larger size induces tensile strain in the Pb-I framework, stabilizing the cubic perovskite phase (α-FAPbI₃) at room temperature. However, pure FAPbI₃ tends to form non-perovskite δ-phase without kinetic control.  \n- **MA⁺ (radius ~2.17 Å)**: Smaller size favors pseudocubic/tetragonal phases with higher configurational entropy. MA⁺ incorporation in FA-based perovskites suppresses δ-phase formation through steric frustration of octahedral tilting.  \n\n**2. Anion-Mediated Crystallization**  \nBoth FAI and MAI provide I⁻ that:  \n- Modulate supersaturation via PbI₆²⁻ complexation kinetics. Excess I⁻ increases solubility, delaying nucleation and enabling larger grains.  \n- Passivate Pb²⁺ undercoordinated sites when incorporated at grain boundaries, reducing non-radiative recombination.  \n\n**3. Stoichiometric Compensation**  \n- MAI volatility during annealing creates PbI₂-rich conditions. Controlled MAI excess compensates for MA⁺ loss, maintaining perovskite stoichiometry.  \n- FAI's lower volatility reduces stoichiometric drift but requires halide management to prevent interfacial iodide vacancies.  \n\n**4. Film Quality Synergy**  \nFA⁺/MA⁺ mixtures (e.g., FA₀.₈₃MA₀.₁₇PbI₃) achieve:  \n- Enhanced phase stability through Goldschmidt tolerance factor optimization (0.9-1.0)  \n- Reduced defect density (10¹⁶→10¹⁵ cm⁻³) via strain relaxation and vacancy suppression  \n- Improved carrier lifetimes (>1 μs) from minimized trap-assisted recombination  \n\nThe anion-cation interplay governs crystallization pathways, where FAI enables thermodynamically stable frameworks while MAI provides kinetic control during nucleation. Optimal blending balances large-grain growth (FA⁺) with rapid surface passivation (MA⁺), achieving high-quality films with minimized bulk and interfacial defects.",

Methylammonium chloride (MACl) forms intermediate adducts with PbI₂ via Pb-Cl coordination, delaying crystallization to enable larger grains. Phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) passivates surface defects through ammonium-Pb²⁺ interactions and π-π stacking at grain boundaries.\n- **Defect Interaction:** Electron-rich groups (e.g., carbonyl in PCBM) coordinate with under-coordinated Pb²⁺, suppressing iodine vacancy (V_I) formation. Bulky organic cations (e.g., PEA⁺) sterically hinder ion migration along grain boundaries.\n- **Film Quality:** Reduce pinhole density (from ~10⁹ cm⁻² to <10⁷ cm⁻²) and increase grain size (300-1000 nm vs. 50-200 nm in pristine films). Enhance PL lifetime from <100 ns to >500 ns via trap state reduction.\n\n**Inorganic Additives (e.g., CsBr, KPF₆, SnCl₂):**\n- **Mechanism:** Smaller ionic radii enable lattice incorporation. Cs⁺ (1.81 Å) substitutes FA⁺ (2.79 Å) in A-site, reducing lattice strain. K⁺ (1.38 Å) occupies interstitial sites, creating compressive stress that inhibits halide migration (activation energy increases from 0.2 eV to 0.5 eV).\n- **Defect Interaction:** Cl⁻ from SnCl₂ fills I⁻ vacancies (E_V = 0.3 eV), while PF₆⁻ anions passivate Pb⁰ metallic defects through strong ionic interactions. Sn²⁵ doping introduces shallow traps (0.1-0.3 eV below conduction band) for charge extraction.\n- **Phase Stability:** Cs-containing additives suppress δ-phase formation by increasing Goldschmidt tolerance factor from 0.81 (FAPbI₃) to 0.92 (Cs₀.₁FA₀.₉PbI₃). KPF₆ additives maintain >90% PCE after 1000h at 85°C vs. <50% for control devices.\n\n**Performance Impact:**\nAdditive engineering typically increases PCE from <18% to >25% through:\n1) Reduced non-radiative recombination (ideality factor n from 2.1 to 1.3)\n2) Enhanced charge mobility (hole mobility from 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻² cm²/Vs)\n3) Lowered Urbach energy (from 25 meV to 15 meV)\n4) Increased built-in potential (from 0.8 V to 1.1 V)\n\nThe chemical design follows Lewis acid-base principles, with additives selected based on Hard-Soft Acid-Base theory to optimize defect passivation efficacy and lattice compatibility.",

    "model_output": "\\\\nPost-deposition additives in perovskite solar cells are molecular or ionic species applied after perovskite crystallization to chemically interact with undercoordinated ions and defect sites. Their function stems from three key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Defect Passivation Chemistry**  \nPerovskite defects (Pb²⁺ undercoordination, I⁻ vacancies, Pb-I antisites) create mid-gap states that promote non-radiative recombination. Additives containing electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH₂, -SH, -COO⁻) coordinate with exposed Pb²+ through Lewis acid-base interactions. For example, thiourea (NH₂-CS-NH₂) binds to Pb²+ via sulfur lone pairs, saturating dangling bonds while simultaneously filling I⁻ vacancies through hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n2. **Charge State Modulation**  \nIonic additives like potassium iodide (KI) preferentially segregate to grain boundaries through Coulombic interactions. K⁺ ions occupy A-site vacancies while I⁻ fills halogen vacancies, simultaneously passivating both cationic and anionic defects. This dual action reduces trap-assisted recombination and suppresses ion migration pathways.\n\n3. **Interface Energy Alignment**  \nConjugated molecules (e.g., phenethylammonium iodide) form 2D perovskite capping layers at grain surfaces. The organic cations induce dipole moments that modify interfacial band bending, improving charge extraction while physically blocking moisture ingress. This simultaneously enhances VOC (through reduced recombination) and device stability.\n\n**Performance Outcomes**  \nEffective additives reduce trap density (Nt) from >10¹⁶ cm⁻³ to <10¹⁵ cm⁻³, increasing carrier lifetimes from <100 ns to >1 μs.
