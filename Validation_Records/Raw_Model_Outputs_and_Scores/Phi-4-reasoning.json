However, the performance and stability of these devices are often limited by defects within the perovskite film, which can act as non-radiative recombination centers and trap charge carriers. Precursor additives have emerged as a strategy to mitigate these issues by passivating defects and enhancing film quality. The key chemical properties of these additives and their interactions with perovskite films are crucial for understanding their role in improving device performance.\n\n### Chemical Properties and Mechanisms\n\n1. **Functional Groups and Binding Affinity**: \n   - Additives often contain functional groups such as amines, thiols, or carboxylates that have a high affinity for binding to defect sites within the perovskite lattice.

Regarding defect passivation, additives with appropriate functional groups can fill vacancy defects in the perovskite lattice. For instance, iodide - based additives can compensate for iodine vacancies in perovskite structures, reducing non - radiative recombination losses and improving device performance.",
    "model_output": "Precursor additives play a crucial role in the crystallization process of perovskite materials, influencing both the morphology and defect landscape of the resulting films, which in turn affects the optoelectronic performance of perovskite solar cells. The mechanisms by which these additives operate can be understood through their interactions with the perovskite precursors and the defects within the crystalline lattice.\n\n### Influence on Crystallization Process\n\n1. **Nucleation and Growth Control**: Precursor additives can modulate the nucleation and growth kinetics of perovskite crystals. By interacting with the perovskite precursors, these additives can either promote or inhibit nucleation. For instance, additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or formamidinium iodide (FAI) can stabilize certain crystal facets, leading to more uniform nucleation and controlled growth. This results in larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries, which are beneficial for charge transport and reduce recombination losses.\n\n2. **Solvent Engineering**: Additives can alter the solvent environment, affecting the solubility and diffusion rates of perovskite precursors.

For example, additives like phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) can passivate lead iodide (PbI₂) defects by forming a stable complex with the lead ions, thereby reducing non-radiative recombination centers.\n\n2. **Bulk Defect Passivation**: Some additives can diffuse into the bulk of the perovskite film and interact with intrinsic defects such as vacancies or interstitials. For instance, additives like 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) can interact with iodide vacancies, effectively passivating these sites and reducing trap-assisted recombination.\n\n3. **Ion Migration Suppression**: Additives can also influence ion migration within the perovskite lattice. By stabilizing the crystal structure or forming complexes with mobile ions, additives can reduce ion migration, which is a significant cause of hysteresis and degradation in perovskite solar cells.\n\n### Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\nThe incorporation of precursor additives leads to improved film quality characterized by larger grain sizes, fewer grain boundaries, and reduced defect densities. These morphological and structural enhancements translate into better optoelectronic properties, such as increased charge carrier mobility, reduced recombination losses, and enhanced light absorption. Consequently, perovskite solar cells with well-optimized additive incorporation exhibit higher power conversion efficiencies, improved stability, and reduced hysteresis.\n\nIn summary, precursor additives influence the crystallization process of perovskite materials through mechanisms that control nucleation and growth, modify solvent interactions, and passivate defects.

This stability is attributed to the ability of FAI to maintain a stable crystal structure and effectively passivate defects.\n   - MAI-based perovskites may be more susceptible to degradation under thermal and environmental stress, leading to reduced device stability over time.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between FAI and MAI as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells lie in their chemical structure and defect passivation capabilities. FAI's larger, planar structure allows for better defect passivation and thermal stability, leading to higher PCE and improved device stability compared to MAI.

However, the performance of these devices is often limited by defects within the perovskite material, which can act as non-radiative recombination centers, reducing both the efficiency and stability of the solar cells. To mitigate these issues, various precursor additives are employed to passivate defects, particularly at the perovskite surfaces. Here, we discuss some common additives and their mechanisms of interaction with metal cations in perovskite surfaces.\n\n### Common Additives for Defect Passivation\n\n1. **Ligands (e.g., Phenethylammonium iodide, PEA-I):**\n   - **Mechanism:** Ligands such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEA-I) are often used to passivate surface defects. The organic cation in PEA-I can interact with the perovskite surface through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding.\n   - **Interaction with Metal Cations:** The phenethylammonium cation can coordinate with lead (Pb) cations at the perovskite surface, effectively passivating Pb vacancies and other surface defects. This coordination reduces the density of trap states by saturating dangling bonds or unsatisfied coordination sites.\n   - **Influence on Film Quality/Device Performance:** By passivating surface defects, these ligands improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film, reduce non-radiative recombination, and enhance charge carrier lifetime, leading to improved device performance and stability.\n\n2. **Halide Additives (e.g., MAI, FAI):**\n   - **Mechanism:** Halide additives such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are used to modify the halide composition at the perovskite surface.\n   - **Interaction with Metal Cations:** These additives can substitute for iodide in the perovskite lattice, particularly at grain boundaries and surfaces, where they can passivate lead and halide vacancies. The presence of additional halide ions can also help in healing defects by promoting the reorientation of the perovskite crystal lattice.\n   - **Influence on Film Quality/Device Performance:** The incorporation of halide additives leads to a reduction in defect density, improved film morphology, and enhanced charge transport properties. This results in higher open-circuit voltages and overall improved device efficiency.\n\n3. **Organometallic Additives (e.g., PbI2):**\n   - **Mechanism:** Organometallic additives like lead iodide (PbI2) are used to control the crystallization process and passivate defects.\n   - **Interaction with Metal Cations:** PbI2 can interact with the perovskite surface by providing additional lead ions that can fill lead vacancies and by forming a more uniform and defect-free perovskite layer. The excess PbI2 can also promote the formation of a more ordered crystal structure.\n   - **Influence on Film Quality/Device Performance:** The use of PbI2 leads to improved film uniformity and reduced defect density, which enhances charge carrier mobility and reduces recombination losses, thereby improving the overall efficiency and stability of the solar cell.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe use of precursor additives in perovskite solar cells is a crucial strategy for defect passivation, particularly at the metal cation sites on the perovskite surfaces. By interacting with lead and halide vacancies, these additives enhance the crystallinity and electronic properties of the perovskite films, leading to improved device performance and stability. The choice of additive and its concentration must be carefully optimized to achieve the desired passivation effects without adversely affecting the perovskite structure.",

    "question": "How do iodine - based precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells?",
    "reference_answer": "Iodine - based precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells by reducing the charge - trapping state. They react with defect sites, forming stable complexes that reduce the density of states at the defect levels through the donation of lone pairs of electrons from iodine atoms to interact with defect - related cations or anions.",
    "model_output": "Iodine-based precursor additives play a crucial role in passivating defects within perovskite solar cells, thereby enhancing film quality and device performance. The underlying mechanism involves the interaction of these additives with the perovskite material, specifically targeting defect sites that can act as recombination centers for charge carriers.\n\n### Chemical and Physical Mechanism\n\n1. **Defect Passivation**: Perovskite materials, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃), often contain intrinsic defects like vacancies (e.g., iodine vacancies, Pb vacancies) and interstitials. These defects can trap charge carriers, leading to non-radiative recombination and reduced device efficiency.\n\n2. **Role of Iodine-Based Additives**: Iodine-based precursors, such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) or cesium iodide (CsI), introduce additional iodide ions into the perovskite lattice. These iodide ions can preferentially occupy iodine vacancy sites, effectively passivating these defects.\n\n3. **Surface Passivation**: Beyond bulk defect passivation, iodine-based additives can also passivate surface defects. The perovskite surface is often rich in defects due to incomplete crystallization and exposure to the environment. Iodine additives can form a passivating layer on the perovskite surface, reducing surface recombination velocities.\n\n### Interaction with Components or Defects\n\n- **Iodine Vacancy Occupation**: The additional iodide ions from the additives can diffuse into the perovskite lattice and occupy iodine vacancy sites. This reduces the density of active defect sites that can trap charge carriers.\n\n- **Formation of a Passivating Layer**: On the surface, iodine-based additives can form a thin, protective layer that passivates surface states. This layer can be composed of a mixture of perovskite and additive material, which stabilizes the surface and reduces defect density.\n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\n- **Improved Crystallinity**: By passivating defects, iodine-based additives promote better crystallization of the perovskite film. This results in larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries, which are potential sites for recombination.\n\n- **Enhanced Charge Carrier Lifetime**: The reduction in defect density leads to a decrease in non-radiative recombination, thereby increasing the charge carrier lifetime. This directly translates to higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) in solar cells.\n\n- **Increased Efficiency**: Overall, the passivation of defects by iodine-based additives leads to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells. The reduction in recombination losses and improved charge transport contribute to this enhancement.\n\nIn summary, iodine-based precursor additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance by passivating both bulk and surface defects, leading to improved crystallinity, reduced recombination, and increased device efficiency.",

The passivation mechanism involves several key interactions and processes:\n\n1. **Chemical Interaction with Defects**: LiI primarily interacts with halide vacancies, which are common point defects in MAPbI\\(_3\\). These vacancies act as deep-level traps, adversely affecting charge carrier dynamics by facilitating non-radiative recombination. The lithium ion (Li\\(^+\\)) from LiI can substitute for lead (Pb\\(^{2+}\\)) in the perovskite lattice, while the iodide ion (I\\(^-\\)) compensates for the halide vacancy. This substitution effectively neutralizes the charge imbalance caused by the vacancy, reducing its ability to trap charge carriers.\n\n2. **Surface Passivation**: LiI also contributes to surface passivation. The perovskite surface is rich in defects, which can act as recombination centers. The adsorption of LiI on the perovskite surface can passivate these surface states. The iodide ions can bond with under-coordinated lead atoms at the surface, reducing the density of surface traps and thus enhancing charge carrier lifetimes.\n\n3. **Influence on Film Quality**: The incorporation of LiI during the film formation process can lead to improved crystallinity and reduced defect density in the perovskite film. This is partly due to the stabilization of the perovskite phase and the suppression of secondary phases, which can form in the presence of defects. Improved crystallinity enhances charge transport properties and reduces recombination losses.\n\n4. **Impact on Device Performance**: The passivation of defects by LiI leads to several beneficial effects on device performance. By reducing non-radiative recombination, LiI increases the open-circuit voltage (V\\(_{oc}\\)) and fill factor (FF) of perovskite solar cells. Additionally, the improved charge carrier dynamics contribute to higher short-circuit current density (J\\(_{sc}\\)), resulting in an overall increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE).\n\nIn summary, LiI passivates defects in perovskite materials through chemical interactions that neutralize halide vacancies and through surface passivation that reduces trap states.

This solubility facilitates the homogeneous distribution of MAI in the precursor solution, ensuring uniform incorporation into the perovskite film during crystallization.\n\n2. **Crystallization Influence**: During the film formation process, MAI acts as a source of both methylammonium (MA\\(^+\\)) and iodide (I\\(^-\\)) ions. The presence of MAI can modulate the crystallization kinetics by providing a controlled release of these ions, which can lead to improved crystallinity and grain size in the perovskite film. Enhanced crystallinity reduces grain boundary defects, which are often sites for non-radiative recombination, thereby improving charge carrier mobility and reducing recombination losses.\n\n3. **Defect Passivation**: MAI contributes to defect passivation through the incorporation of iodide ions, which can passivate lead vacancies and other defect sites within the perovskite lattice. This passivation is crucial because it reduces the density of trap states that can capture charge carriers, thereby enhancing the open-circuit voltage (V\\(_{oc}\\)) and overall PCE of the solar cell.\n\n4. **Phase Stabilization**: The presence of MAI can stabilize the desired perovskite phase (MAPbI\\(_3\\)) by preventing the formation of secondary phases, such as lead iodide (PbI\\(_2\\)), which can occur under certain conditions. This stabilization is important for maintaining the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film.\n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\n- **Improved Film Morphology**: By enhancing crystallinity and reducing defect density, MAI leads to smoother and more uniform perovskite films. This improved morphology is associated with better light absorption and reduced charge carrier recombination, contributing to higher PCE.\n\n- **Enhanced Stability**: The passivation of defects and stabilization of the perovskite phase contribute to the long-term stability of the solar cells. MAI helps mitigate degradation pathways, such as ion migration and phase segregation, which are common challenges in perovskite solar cells.\n\n- **Optimized Device Performance**: The combined effects of improved crystallinity, defect passivation, and phase stabilization result in enhanced optoelectronic properties, such as increased V\\(_{oc}\\), short-circuit current density (J\\(_{sc}\\)), and fill factor (FF), all of which contribute to higher PCE.\n\nIn summary, the key chemical properties of MAI as a perovskite precursor additive—its solubility, role in crystallization, and ability to passivate defects—play a crucial role in enhancing the film quality and device performance of perovskite solar cells.

Metal ions can react with other components to form the perovskite structure during crystallization, halides can participate in the lattice formation. They function by promoting crystal growth, influencing the stoichiometry of the perovskite, and passivating defects.

These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers, which can significantly reduce the efficiency of solar cells by trapping charge carriers.\n\n2. **Role of Precursor Additives**: Precursor additives are small organic or inorganic molecules introduced into the perovskite precursor solution. These additives are designed to interact specifically with defect sites during the film formation process.\n\n3. **Complex Formation**: The additives contain functional groups that can form stable coordination complexes with defect sites. For instance, additives with halogenated groups can interact with halide vacancies through halogen bonding or ionic interactions. Similarly, additives with lone pairs of electrons can coordinate with metal cations at defect sites.\n\n4. **Passivation Mechanism**: By forming stable complexes with defect sites, the additives effectively \"passivate\" these sites. This passivation reduces the density of active defect states that can trap charge carriers. The stabilization of the perovskite lattice through these complexes also helps in reducing ion migration, which is another source of instability in perovskite solar cells.\n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\n1. **Improved Film Morphology**: The interaction between additives and defect sites leads to a more uniform and dense perovskite film. This is because the additives can influence the crystallization kinetics, promoting the growth of larger grains and reducing the number of grain boundaries, which are potential sites for defect formation.\n\n2. **Enhanced Charge Carrier Lifetime**: By passivating defects, the additives reduce non-radiative recombination pathways, thereby increasing the charge carrier lifetime. This improvement directly translates to higher open-circuit voltage (\\( V_{\\text{oc}} \\)) and fill factor (FF) in the solar cell.\n\n3. **Increased Stability**: The stabilization of the perovskite structure through defect passivation also contributes to the long-term stability of the solar cells. Reduced ion migration and defect-related degradation mechanisms lead to improved operational stability under environmental stressors such as moisture and heat.\n\nIn summary, precursor additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance by forming stable complexes with defect sites, thereby passivating these defects. This passivation leads to improved film morphology, increased charge carrier lifetime, and enhanced device stability, ultimately resulting in higher efficiency and durability of the solar cells.",

    "model_output": "Halides play a crucial role in the defect passivation of perovskite lattices, primarily through their interaction with metal cations and the modification of defect states. The underlying mechanism involves the chemical and physical interactions between halide ions and the perovskite structure, which influence both the crystallization process and the electronic properties of the material.\n\n### Chemical and Physical Mechanism\n\n1. **Halide Ion Incorporation**: Halides, such as iodide (I⁻), bromide (Br⁻), and chloride (Cl⁻), can be incorporated into the perovskite lattice during the crystallization process. This incorporation can occur through the use of halide additives in the precursor solution or by post-deposition treatment.\n\n2. **Interaction with Metal Cations**: Halide ions interact with metal cations (e.g., Pb²⁺ in methylammonium lead halide perovskites, CH₃NH₃PbX₃) by coordinating with them. This coordination can lead to the stabilization of the perovskite structure by reducing the formation of non-radiative recombination centers, which are often associated with metal cation vacancies or interstitials.\n\n3. **Defect Passivation**: Halides can passivate defects by occupying vacancies or by forming complexes with metal cations that would otherwise act as trap states. For instance, halide ions can passivate lead vacancies (V_Pb) by forming stable Pb-X bonds, thereby reducing the density of electronic states within the bandgap that contribute to non-radiative recombination.\n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\n1. **Improved Crystallinity**: The presence of halides can enhance the crystallinity of the perovskite film by promoting a more uniform and defect-free lattice. This is achieved through the reduction of defect densities and the stabilization of the perovskite phase, leading to larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries.\n\n2. **Reduced Trap States**: By passivating defects, halides decrease the density of trap states within the perovskite material. This reduction in trap states leads to improved charge carrier lifetimes and mobility, which are critical for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.\n\n3. **Enhanced Photovoltaic Efficiency**: The overall effect of halide-induced defect passivation is an increase in the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF) of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is due to the reduction in non-radiative recombination pathways, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE).\n\nIn summary, halides interact with metal cations in the perovskite lattice to passivate defects, primarily by stabilizing the lattice and reducing trap state densities.

This effect is primarily attributed to their interactions with the perovskite precursor solution and the resulting modifications in the crystallization dynamics and defect chemistry.\n\n### Lithium Iodide (LiI)\n\n**Mechanism and Interaction:**\nLiI acts as a nucleation promoter and growth modulator in the perovskite crystallization process. The lithium cation (Li⁺) interacts with the perovskite precursor solution, particularly with the lead iodide (PbI₂) component, by forming a complex with iodide ions (I⁻). This interaction reduces the solubility of PbI₂, promoting nucleation at lower temperatures and earlier stages of the crystallization process.\n\n**Influence on Growth Rate and Orientation:**\n- **Growth Rate:** The presence of LiI leads to a more controlled and slower growth rate of perovskite crystals. This is due to the stabilization of the PbI₂ phase, which delays the transition to the perovskite phase, allowing for more uniform nucleation and growth.\n- **Orientation:** LiI promotes the formation of a preferred crystallographic orientation, typically enhancing the (100) facet growth. This orientation is beneficial for charge transport and reduces grain boundary defects, which are detrimental to device performance.\n\n### Formamidinium Iodide (FAI)\n\n**Mechanism and Interaction:**\nFAI introduces formamidinium cations (FA⁺) into the perovskite structure, replacing or coexisting with methylammonium (MA⁺) cations. The FA⁺ cation has a larger organic moiety compared to MA⁺, which influences the lattice parameters and the overall stability of the perovskite crystal.\n\n**Influence on Growth Rate and Orientation:**\n- **Growth Rate:** The incorporation of FAI can lead to a faster crystallization process due to the increased solubility and reduced phase transition temperature of the FA-based perovskite precursors. This results in a more rapid formation of the perovskite phase.\n- **Orientation:** FAI tends to promote a different crystallographic orientation compared to MA-based perovskites. The larger FA⁺ cation can stabilize different facets, often leading to a more isotropic growth pattern. This can result in a more compact film with fewer grain boundaries, enhancing device performance by reducing recombination sites.\n\n### Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\nThe combined use of LiI and FAI in perovskite solar cells leads to improved film quality and device performance. The controlled growth rate and preferred orientation induced by LiI reduce defect densities and enhance charge transport. Meanwhile, the incorporation of FAI improves the thermal and environmental stability of the perovskite film, contributing to longer device lifetimes and higher power conversion efficiencies.

    "model_output": "Iodine-based precursor additives in perovskite solar cells are employed to passivate defect sites, primarily through the formation of iodide ions (I⁻) that interact with defect sites within the perovskite crystal lattice. The underlying mechanism involves the chemical interaction between the iodide ions and the defect sites, which are often associated with vacancies or interstitials that can act as recombination centers, adversely affecting the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite material.\n\n### Chemical and Physical Mechanism\n\n1. **Formation of Iodide Ions**: Iodine-based precursors, such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) or cesium iodide (CsI), decompose during the film formation process to release iodide ions. These ions are highly mobile and can diffuse throughout the perovskite film.\n\n2. **Interaction with Defect Sites**: The iodide ions preferentially interact with defect sites, such as lead (Pb) vacancies (V_Pb) and iodine vacancies (V_I), which are common in perovskite structures. The interaction typically involves the formation of a complex or coordination with the defect site, effectively neutralizing the defect's electronic activity.\n\n3. **Passivation of Defects**: By occupying or coordinating with these defect sites, iodide ions reduce the density of active recombination centers. This passivation occurs because the iodide ions can donate electrons to neutralize positively charged vacancies or accept electrons to neutralize negatively charged interstitials, thereby reducing non-radiative recombination pathways.\n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance\n\n- **Improved Film Morphology**: The presence of iodide ions can lead to a more uniform and dense perovskite film by promoting better crystallization and reducing grain boundary defects. This results in enhanced charge transport properties.\n\n- **Enhanced Photovoltaic Performance**: Passivation of defect sites reduces non-radiative recombination losses, leading to increased open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF) in perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device is improved.\n\n- **Stability Enhancement**: By mitigating defect-related degradation pathways, iodide-based passivation can also contribute to the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells, addressing one of the critical challenges in their commercialization.\n\nIn summary, iodine-based precursor additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance by passivating defect sites through the formation of iodide complexes, leading to improved film quality and device efficiency.",

    "reference_answer": "Precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells by coordinating with metal cations to reduce cation vacancies, reacting with halide anions to eliminate halide vacancies or interstitials, and forming surface coatings to block non-radiative recombination centers.",
    "model_output": "Precursor additives play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells by passivating defects, which are intrinsic or extrinsic imperfections in the perovskite crystal lattice that can act as non-radiative recombination centers, adversely affecting device efficiency. The passivation mechanism involves several key interactions and processes:\n\n1. **Chemical Interaction with Defect Sites**: Precursor additives often contain functional groups that can chemically interact with defect sites within the perovskite lattice. For instance, additives like phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI) can donate or accept electrons, forming stable complexes with defect sites such as vacancies or interstitials. This interaction neutralizes the charge states of these defects, reducing their ability to act as recombination centers.\n\n2. **Surface Passivation**: Additives can also passivate surface defects, which are prevalent in perovskite films due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. By adsorbing onto the perovskite surface, additives form a protective layer that mitigates surface trap states. This is particularly important for grain boundaries, where additives can bridge the interface, reducing trap-assisted recombination.\n\n3. **Influence on Crystallization Dynamics**: During the film formation process, additives can influence the crystallization kinetics and morphology of the perovskite. By modulating nucleation and growth rates, additives promote the formation of larger grains with fewer grain boundaries, inherently reducing the density of defect sites. This results in a more uniform and defect-free film, enhancing charge transport and reducing recombination losses.\n\n4. **Stabilization of the Perovskite Structure**: Some additives contribute to the stabilization of the perovskite crystal structure by incorporating into the lattice or forming a secondary phase that reinforces the perovskite matrix. This structural stabilization can prevent phase segregation and improve thermal and moisture stability, indirectly reducing defect formation over time.\n\nThe overall influence of these passivation mechanisms is an improvement in film quality, characterized by enhanced crystallinity, reduced defect density, and improved surface morphology. Consequently, the device performance is significantly enhanced, with increased power conversion efficiency, improved open-circuit voltage, and better long-term stability. These improvements are attributed to the reduction in non-radiative recombination pathways and enhanced charge carrier lifetimes, which are critical for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.",

This substitution can stabilize the perovskite phase, reduce phase segregation, and enhance thermal stability.\n   \n2. **Surface Passivation:** These cations can adsorb onto the perovskite surface, passivating surface defects such as PbI₂ or PbI₄ species. This passivation reduces non-radiative recombination pathways, thereby improving charge carrier lifetime and overall device performance.\n\n3. **Nucleation and Growth Control:** By influencing the nucleation kinetics and growth rates of perovskite crystals, organic cations can promote the formation of uniform, dense films with fewer grain boundaries and defects.\n\n**Resulting Influence:**\nThe incorporation of organic cations leads to improved film quality, characterized by enhanced crystallinity, reduced defect density, and optimized grain size. These improvements translate to higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and better stability in perovskite solar cells.\n\n### Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)-Based Additives\n\n**Chemical Nature:**\nMOF-based additives are composed of metal ions coordinated to organic ligands, forming porous crystalline structures. These frameworks can be engineered to include functional groups that interact with perovskite precursors.\n\n**Mechanism and Interaction:**\n1. **Template for Crystallization:** MOFs can act as templates that guide the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. The porous structure of MOFs can control the spatial arrangement and orientation of perovskite grains, leading to improved film morphology.\n\n2. **Defect Passivation:** Functional groups within MOFs can interact with perovskite surfaces or interfaces, passivating defects and reducing trap states. This interaction can occur through coordination bonds or hydrogen bonding, which stabilize the perovskite structure.\n\n3. **Ion Exchange and Doping:** MOFs can facilitate ion exchange processes, where metal ions from the MOF are incorporated into the perovskite lattice, potentially doping the material and modifying its electronic properties.\n\n**Resulting Influence:**\nThe use of MOF-based additives can lead to perovskite films with enhanced uniformity, reduced defect density, and improved charge transport properties. These enhancements contribute to higher PCE, increased open-circuit voltage (Voc), and improved long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.\n\nIn summary, both organic cation-based and MOF-based precursor additives significantly influence the crystallization, morphology, and defect landscape of perovskite films. Through mechanisms such as lattice incorporation, surface passivation, and controlled nucleation, these additives enhance the optoelectronic properties and performance of perovskite solar cells.",
