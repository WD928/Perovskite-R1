For example, some additives can passivate defects through chemical bonding, reducing non - radiative recombination and improving charge carrier mobility, which in turn enhances device performance like power conversion efficiency.",

    "question": "What is the role of iodide ions provided by ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) additives in perovskite crystallization?",
    "reference_answer": "Iodide ions from ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are crucial for the formation of the perovskite crystal structure. NH₄I acts as a source of iodide ions to control the crystallization process by providing an iodide concentration gradient, and FAI provides iodide ions along with the formamidinium cation which can influence the stoichiometry and crystal lattice of the perovskite, together assisting in achieving a well - defined perovskite morphology during crystallization.",
    "model_output": "Iodide ions from ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) play a crucial role in perovskite crystallization as they serve as the halide component in the perovskite structure, with the iodide ions interacting with metal cations to form the perovskite lattice, thus directly influencing the formation and quality of the perovskite film and ultimately the device performance.",

    "question": "What are the chemical nature and typical functions of organic cation-based and metal-organic framework (MOF)-based precursor additives in perovskite solar cells?",
    "reference_answer": "Organic cation-based additives usually contain simple organic cations like methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), with a relatively simple chemical nature that mainly function by controlling crystallization and passivating defects through electrostatic interactions. MOF-based additives have a more complex chemical structure with metal ions coordinated to organic ligands and can influence perovskite formation through multiple mechanisms such as providing reaction sites, regulating ion transport, and enhancing intermolecular interactions.",
    "model_output": "Organic cation-based precursor additives typically contain organic cations like methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), etc., which can influence perovskite crystallization by adjusting the stoichiometry and providing a template for crystal growth, while metal-organic framework (MOF)-based additives can interact with the perovskite lattice through coordination bonds, influencing film morphology and passivating defects, both of which can enhance film quality and device performance.",
