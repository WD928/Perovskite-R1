    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts, such as formamidinium (FA⁺) and methylammonium (MA⁺), function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by modulating crystallization kinetics, passivating defects, and stabilizing the perovskite lattice. Their effects arise from their role as cationic components in the ABX₃ perovskite structure (where A = FA/MA, B = Pb, and X = halide anions). Below is a structured explanation of their mechanisms:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Influence on Crystallization Kinetics**  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  FA⁺ and MA⁺ cations in the precursor solution act as structural templates during nucleation and growth. Their presence slows nucleation by competing with Pb²⁺ for coordination with halide anions (e.g., I⁻), delaying the formation of perovskite nuclei. This extended nucleation period reduces the density of nucleation sites, favoring **large-grained crystallization**.  \n  - **Grain boundary reduction**: Larger grains minimize non-radiative recombination pathways at grain boundaries, enhancing charge carrier lifetime.  \n  - **Orientation control**: Additives may direct crystallographic orientation (e.g., promoting (110) over (001) facets), optimizing charge transport pathways.  \n\n- **Interaction with Components**:  \n  The organic cations form transient coordination complexes with Pb²⁺ and halides in solution, altering the solubility and reactivity of precursors. This delays phase conversion from intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂) to the perovskite phase, enabling more homogeneous film formation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  Mixed-cation alloying (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃) introduces **lattice strain** due to the mismatch in ionic radii between FA⁺ (larger) and MA⁺ (smaller). This strain suppresses defect formation by:  \n  - **Filling vacancies**: FA⁺/MA⁺ ions occupy interstitial or substitutional sites, passivating Pb vacancies (Pb⁻) and halide vacancies (X⁺), which are major recombination centers.  \n  - **Bonding interactions**: Hydrogen bonds between the organic cations and halide anions stabilize the lattice, reducing halide vacancy formation.  \n  - **Charge screening**: The polarizable FA⁺ cation screens charges at defect sites, reducing trap states.  \n\n- **Resulting Effects**:  \n  Reduced defect density lowers non-radiative recombination, improving open-circuit voltage (**Voc**) and fill factor (**FF**).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Impact on Film Quality and Stability**  \n- **Film Quality**:  \n  - **Homogeneity**: Additives promote pinhole-free films by slowing solvent evaporation and enabling uniform phase conversion.  \n  - **Phase purity**: Mixed cations stabilize the α-phase (thermodynamically favorable) over metastable δ-phase, reducing phase segregation.  \n\n- **Stability**:  \n  - **Thermal stability**: FA-rich compositions exhibit higher thermal stability due to stronger Pb–I bonding and reduced ion migration pathways.  \n  - **Moisture resistance**: Mixed cations hinder ion migration by creating a rigid lattice, delaying halide segregation and degradation.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Influence on Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)**  \n- **Bandgap Tuning**:  \n  FA/MA mixing allows tuning the bandgap between ~1.5 eV (MA) and ~1.3 eV (FA), optimizing absorption of the solar spectrum and enhancing **short-circuit current (Jsc)**.  \n- **Reduced Recombination**:  \n  Fewer defects and grain boundaries improve **Voc** and **FF**, directly boosting PCE.  \n- **Stability-Performance Synergy**:  \n  Enhanced stability prevents efficiency degradation over time, maintaining high PCE under operational conditions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nOrganic ammonium additives function by synergistically controlling crystallization, passivating defects, and stabilizing the perovskite lattice. These effects collectively improve film quality, reduce recombination losses, and enhance both initial PCE and long-term stability, making them critical for high-performance and durable perovskite solar cells.",

The hydrophobic alkyl chains form a protective overlayer, repelling moisture and oxygen.  \n\n**Interaction**: The –COO⁻ group binds to Pb²⁺ via dative bonding, while the hydrocarbon tail orients away from the surface.  \n\n**Impact**: Reduces surface recombination and environmental degradation, enhancing both efficiency and operational stability.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Guanidinium’s Polarizable Groups**  \n**Mechanism**: The guanidinium cation (–N=C(NH₂)₂) exhibits strong electron-donating character due to resonance-stabilized charge delocalization.

    "reference_answer": "Iodine-based precursor additives, such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI), play a crucial role in perovskite solar cells. They provide iodide ions which are essential for the formation of the perovskite crystal structure. During the crystallization process, these iodide ions react with metal cations (e.g., lead in lead halide perovskites) to form the perovskite lattice. The presence of iodine-based additives helps in controlling the crystallization kinetics, promoting the growth of well-defined and homogeneous perovskite films. This, in turn, leads to improved device performance as it enhances charge carrier mobility, reduces defect density, and increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells.",
    "model_output": "Iodine-based precursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a critical role in modulating crystallization kinetics, stoichiometry, and defect density, thereby enhancing film quality and device performance. Their mechanism of action involves multiple interrelated processes:\n\n### 1. **Stoichiometric Compensation and Crystallization Kinetics**  \nIodine additives (e.g., MAI, FAI, or elemental I₂) address iodide (I⁻) deficiency during the precursor solution mixing and annealing steps. Perovskite precursors (e.g., PbI₂ and organic cations) often exhibit non-stoichiometric ratios due to evaporation or reaction kinetics, leading to Pb²⁺ vacancies. Excess iodide from the additive compensates for this deficit, ensuring proper stoichiometry (e.g., ABX₃, where A = MA/FA, B = Pb, X = I).  \n\nThe additive also slows nucleation by forming metastable intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂-rich regions) or solvated complexes, delaying perovskite nucleation. This extended nucleation lag phase promotes homogenous ion diffusion and reduces defect-rich nucleation sites. The subsequent crystallization proceeds via oriented attachment of nanocrystals, yielding larger grain sizes (typically >1 µm) with fewer grain boundaries.\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation**  \nIodine additives mitigate intrinsic defects such as Pb vacancies (V_Pb) and interstitial organic cations (e.g., MA⁺i), which act as non-radiative recombination centers. Excess I⁻ ions substitute into the lattice, filling V_Pb sites and reducing electron traps. This passivation lowers mid-gap trap densities, as evidenced by improved photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes and reduced hysteresis in current-voltage (J-V) curves. Additionally, iodine may suppress mixed-halide segregation (e.g., in FA/MA/Pb/I/Br systems) by stabilizing the desired phase composition.\n\n### 3. **Morphological Optimization**  \nThe additive promotes pinhole-free, smooth films with reduced surface roughness. Slower crystallization kinetics enable better wetting of the substrate (e.g., SnO₂ or TiO₂) and uniform film coverage. Larger grain domains minimize grain boundary density, enhancing charge carrier diffusion lengths and reducing recombination at these interfaces. This results in improved carrier collection efficiency and fill factor (FF).\n\n### 4. **Phase Purity and Structural Stability**  \nExcess iodide suppresses the formation of non-perovskite phases (e.g., δ-phase PbI₂) during annealing, promoting the α-phase perovskite. This enhances structural stability under operational conditions, delaying degradation from ion migration or moisture exposure.\n\n### **Impact on Device Performance**  \n- **Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc):** Reduced defect density and improved carrier lifetimes elevate Voc by minimizing non-radiative recombination.  \n- **Fill Factor (FF):** Larger grains and fewer recombination sites enhance charge transport, boosting FF.  \n- **Efficiency:** Combined improvements in Voc, FF, and light absorption (via optimal bandgap tuning in mixed-halide systems) lead to higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nIodine-based additives function as both stoichiometric regulators and crystallization modulators, enabling high-quality perovskite films with reduced defects and enhanced optoelectronic properties. Their role is pivotal in bridging the gap between laboratory-scale and industrially viable PSCs by improving reproducibility and long-term stability.",

Mechanism of Action During Crystallization**\n#### **Ammonium Iodide (NH₄I):**\n- **Nucleation and Growth Modulation:**  \n  NH₄⁺ ions act as **heteronucleation sites**, slowing the initial nucleation rate while promoting homogeneous crystal growth. This delay reduces competitive Ostwald ripening, enabling larger, more uniform perovskite grains with fewer defects. The small size and high mobility of NH₄⁺ allow it to intercalate into the precursor solution, altering solubility dynamics and delaying phase separation.\n  \n- **Lattice Incorporation:**  \n  NH₄⁺ substitutes into the A-site cation positions (e.g., replacing FA⁺ or MA⁺), forming mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈MA₀.₂PbI₃). This substitution stabilizes the black (α-phase) perovskite structure by suppressing δ-phase formation and phase segregation.\n\n#### **Formamidinium Iodide (FAI):**\n- **Stoichiometry Control:**  \n  FAI provides excess FA⁺ cations, ensuring stoichiometric Pb²⁺:A-site ratios. This minimizes PbI₂-rich domains and vacancies, which are major sources of non-radiative recombination. Excess FA⁺ also acts as a **solvent additive**, lowering the precursor viscosity and improving film coverage during spin-coating.\n\n- **Crystallization Kinetics:**  \n  FAI slows crystallization by forming FA⁺-rich domains that hinder rapid nucleation. This extended nucleation period allows for better grain alignment and reduced pinhole density, improving film homogeneity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**\n#### **NH₄I:**\n- **Interstitial and Vacancy Passivation:**  \n  NH₄⁺ ions occupy interstitial sites or fill A-site vacancies, passivating deep-level traps (e.g., Pb vacancies or iodine interstitials). This reduces mid-gap states that promote non-radiative recombination.\n  \n- **Surface Passivation:**  \n  NH₄⁺ forms a surface layer on perovskite grains, passivating surface defects such as undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions. This suppresses electron-hole recombination at grain boundaries.\n\n#### **FAI:**\n- **A-Site Defect Suppression:**  \n  Excess FA⁺ ensures complete occupation of A-sites, preventing Pb vacancies (V_Pb²⁺) and associated defects. FA⁺ also stabilizes the perovskite lattice against iodide vacancy formation (V_I⁻).\n  \n- **Charge Carrier Lifetime Enhancement:**  \n  FAI-induced FA-rich regions reduce trap densities, improving charge carrier mobility and lifetime by minimizing recombination pathways.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

NH₄I enhances lateral grain growth, while FAI improves vertical crystallinity, leading to better charge transport pathways.\n\n- **Optoelectronic Properties:**  \n  - **Voc (Open-Circuit Voltage):** Reduced defect densities and improved bandgap uniformity (via FAI’s phase stabilization) boost Voc.  \n  - **Jsc (Short-Circuit Current):** Enhanced light absorption and reduced non-radiative losses increase Jsc.  \n  - **FF (Fill Factor):** Lower recombination losses and better charge extraction elevate FF.  \n\n- **PCE Enhancement:**  \n  Combined effects of reduced defects, improved carrier dynamics, and optimized morphology lead to PCE improvements. NH₄I typically enhances stability and grain size, while FAI optimizes stoichiometry and phase purity, synergistically elevating PCE to >25% in state-of-the-art devices.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Interactions and Trade-offs**\n- **NH₄I:** Overdosing may induce NH₄⁺ segregation at grain boundaries or promote δ-phase formation, degrading performance. Optimal concentrations (0.5–2 mol%) balance nucleation control and defect passivation.  \n- **FAI:** Excess FAI can delay crystallization excessively, causing phase separation or under-crystallization. Synergistic use with NH₄I often yields optimal results by combining stoichiometry control and nucleation modulation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nNH₄I and FAI function as dual-functional additives: NH₄I primarily modulates crystallization kinetics and passivates defects via lattice substitution, while FAI ensures stoichiometric balance and stabilizes the perovskite phase.

For example, molecules like 5-aminovaleric acid (5AVA) or guanidinium (GA) bind to Pb²⁺ via nitrogen lone pairs, passivating vacancies and reducing non-radiative recombination.

Their efficacy arises from three primary mechanisms: **defect passivation via coordination chemistry**, **crystallization kinetics modulation**, and **interfacial defect suppression**.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Defect Passivation via Coordination Chemistry**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃) inherently contain defects such as Pb²⁺ vacancies, interstitial I⁻, and undercoordinated metal/halide ions at grain boundaries or surfaces. These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers, reducing charge-carrier lifetime and device efficiency.  \n\n**Mechanism**: Organic additives (e.g., 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) possess functional groups (e.g., pyridine N, carboxylate O) that coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or halide ions at defect sites. For instance, the pyridine N in 4-TBP donates electrons to Pb²⁺ vacancies, stabilizing them and preventing charge trapping. Similarly, bulky additives like PCBM may physically block defect sites via steric hindrance, reducing trap densities.  \n\n**Interaction with Perovskite Lattice**: Additives bind to defect sites through **dative bonding** (e.g., N→Pb²⁺) or **hydrogen bonding** (e.g., O-H···I⁻), passivating localized electronic states that would otherwise form mid-gap trap states.

In the precursor solution, excess ammonium salts provide a reservoir of A-site cations to compensate for non-stoichiometric defects (e.g., PbI₃⁻ vacancies or undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites) that arise due to incomplete reaction of PbI₂ with halides.  \n  - **Defect filling**: MA⁺/FA⁺ ions substitute for missing A-site cations, directly passivating iodide vacancies (I⁻ vacancies) and reducing trap states.  \n  - **Coordination stabilization**: These cations can bind to undercoordinated halide ions at grain boundaries or surfaces, forming hydrogen bonds or coordinating with dangling Pb²⁺ sites, thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways.  \n\n- **Result**: Reduced density of deep-level defects (e.g., PbI₃⁻ vacancies) improves charge carrier lifetime and Voc (open-circuit voltage).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  Excess ammonium salts slow nucleation and promote **controlled crystal growth** by:  \n  - **Slowing precursor reaction rates**: MA⁺/FA⁺ complexes with PbI₂ in the precursor solution, delaying its conversion to perovskite. This extends the nucleation phase, favoring fewer but larger grains.  \n  - **Reducing Ostwald ripening**: The additives may form a gradient in the precursor film, directing growth toward 2D-to-3D phase evolution and minimizing defects associated with rapid crystallization (e.g., twins or cracks).  \n\n- **Result**: Enhanced grain size and reduced grain boundary density improve charge carrier mobility and reduce recombination losses, boosting FF (fill factor) and Jsc (short-circuit current).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Structural Stabilization and Mixed-Cation Effects**  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  When added to MA- or FA-based perovskites, these additives can induce **mixed-cation configurations** (e.g., FA/MA co-occupation of A-sites), even in nominally single-cation films. The larger FA⁺ ion (vs. MA⁺) introduces lattice strain, which:  \n  - **Suppresses phase segregation**: Stabilizes the perovskite phase against decomposition (e.g., α→δ phase transition) under operational conditions.  \n  - **Passivates interfacial defects**: Mixed cations reduce energetic disorder at interfaces (e.g., perovskite/HTL), lowering interfacial recombination.  \n\n- **Result**: Improved thermal and operational stability, alongside reduced hysteresis in device performance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Suppression of Non-Stoichiometric Defects**  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  Excess ammonium salts ensure **stoichiometric excess of A-site cations**, counteracting halide loss (e.g., I⁻ evaporation during annealing). This prevents undercoordination of Pb²⁺, which is a major source of mid-gap states.  \n\n- **Result**: Enhanced overall film quality with reduced trap densities, leading to higher V_oc and lower non-radiative losses.\n\n---\n\n### **Device Performance Impact**  \nThese mechanisms collectively result in:  \n- **Higher charge carrier mobility** (via larger grains and fewer defects).  \n- **Reduced recombination losses** (via defect passivation and interface stabilization).  \n- **Improved stability** (via mixed-cation effects and defect suppression).  \n\nFor example, FA additives in MA-based perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₂MA₀.₈PbI₃) enhance Voc by mitigating PbI₃⁻ vacancy defects, while MA additives in precursor solutions improve grain morphology, boosting FF. Such synergies underpin the record efficiencies observed in mixed-cation perovskite solar cells.  \n\nThis mechanistic interplay underscores the role of ammonium salts as both **structural modifiers** and **defect engineering tools**, critical for advancing perovskite optoelectronics.",

Crystallization Mechanism and Kinetic Control**  \nFAI and MAI, as organic cation precursors, participate in the nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase (ABX₃, where A = FA⁺/MA⁺, B = Pb²⁺, X = I⁻). When added to precursor solutions (e.g., PbI₂ dissolved in polar solvents like dimethylformamide), they slow the reaction kinetics by delaying the irreversible PbI₂-to-perovskite conversion.

Large grain sizes (micron-scale) minimize grain boundary recombination, enhancing charge transport.  \n- **Device Performance**: The combined effects of defect passivation and optimized stoichiometry improve open-circuit voltage (Voc) by reducing recombination losses, increase short-circuit current (Jsc) via enhanced light absorption, and boost fill factor (FF) through better charge collection. Mixed-cation systems also exhibit improved thermal and environmental stability due to reduced ion migration pathways.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nFAI and MAI function synergistically as both kinetic regulators and defect mitigators. Their role in slowing crystallization, passivating Pb vacancies, and enabling mixed-cation compositions directly translates to high-quality perovskite films with superior optoelectronic properties, underpinning the record efficiencies (>25%) observed in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells.",

The mechanisms involve chemical interactions with defect sites and structural defects, which directly influence charge transport and stability.\n\n### **1. Chemical/Physical Mechanisms of Defect Passivation**  \nAmine additives (e.g., methylamine, phenyltrimethylammonium, or alkylamines) interact with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ cations or halide vacancies (e.g., I⁻ vacancies) in the perovskite lattice. These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers and trap states, reducing charge carrier lifetime and mobility.  \n\n- **Coordination with Pb²⁺ Defects**: Amines bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites via lone-pair donation, neutralizing their charge and filling Pb vacancies.

Mechanism of Action**  \nFABr introduces **bromide ions (Br⁻)** and **formamidinium cations (FA⁺)** into the perovskite precursor solution. During spin-coating or vapor-assisted crystallization, Br⁻ substitutes iodide (I⁻) in the perovskite lattice (e.g., in the mixed-halide FAₙMA₁₋ₙPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ system), forming a **graded or alloyed halide composition**. The larger ionic radius of Br⁻ (vs. I⁻) induces **lattice strain**, which slows nucleation and promotes **controlled crystal growth**, favoring large, uniform grains. Concurrently, FA⁺ contributes to the cationic component of the perovskite, stabilizing the tetragonal phase and reducing phase segregation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Interaction with Components/Defects**  \n- **Halide Alloying and Strain Effects**:  \n  Bromide incorporation disrupts the ideal stoichiometry of the perovskite lattice, creating **point defects** (e.g., Br⁻ substituting I⁻ at the X-site). While some defects may form initially, the strain-driven slow crystallization suppresses non-equilibrium defect formation (e.g., PbI₂ residues) by prolonging the solution-phase mixing and allowing more ordered nucleation.  \n- **Defect Passivation**:  \n  Bromide’s higher electronegativity and lower ionization energy compared to iodide reduce the concentration of **I⁻ vacancies** (a major source of deep-level traps). Br⁻ also passivates **grain boundaries** and surfaces by preferentially occupying defect sites, reducing non-radiative recombination pathways. Additionally, the mixed halide composition stabilizes the perovskite against **ion migration** (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺ cation diffusion) under operational conditions.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Crystallization Process**:  \n  The lattice strain from Br⁻ slows nucleation, enabling **homogeneous crystal growth** with reduced pinholes and roughness. This results in **large-grained films** (typically >1 µm) with fewer grain boundaries, improving charge-carrier diffusion lengths.  \n- **Defect Reduction**:  \n  Passivation of I⁻ vacancies and grain boundary defects enhances **open-circuit voltage (Voc)** by minimizing recombination losses and improving the built-in potential. Reduced non-radiative pathways also boost **charge-carrier lifetime**.  \n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)**:  \n  The combined effects of high-quality films and reduced defects elevate **short-circuit current (Jsc)** (via improved light absorption and charge extraction) and **fill factor (FF)** (via lower recombination and better transport). Recent reports show PCE improvements of ~1–3% absolute in FABr-optimized devices.  \n- **Stability**:  \n  Bromide-rich regions are less susceptible to moisture-induced degradation and **hysteresis** due to suppressed ion migration. The mixed halide composition also mitigates **thermal instability** by stabilizing the tetragonal phase, enhancing long-term operational stability (e.g., reduced efficiency decay over 1000 hours under light soaking).  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nFABr acts as a dual-functional additive by modulating crystallization dynamics and passivating defects through halide alloying. Its incorporation into perovskite films suppresses non-equilibrium defects, enhances charge transport, and stabilizes the material structure, thereby improving PCE and operational stability.

    "model_output": "**Key Chemical Mechanisms of Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells**  \n\n### **1. Defect Passivation via Substitution or Site Occupancy**  \nPerovskite films (typically ABX₃, e.g., CH₃NH₃PbI₃) suffer from intrinsic defects such as iodide vacancies (V_I⁻), interstitial Pb, and interfacial defects, which act as non-radiative recombination centers. Additives mitigate these defects through:  \n- **A-site substitution**: Organic cations (e.g., phenylethylammonium, PEA⁺; formamidinium, FA⁺) substitute into the A-site lattice, filling vacancies and reducing V_I⁻ density. Their larger size induces lattice strain, suppressing ion migration and stabilizing the perovskite phase.  \n- **X-site substitution**: Halide additives (e.g., Cl⁻, Br⁻) replace I⁻ in the X-site, passivating iodide vacancies. Cl⁻, being smaller, forms mixed-halide regions (e.g., FAPEA-Pb(I/Cl)₃) with narrower bandgaps, enhancing light absorption while reducing defect-induced mid-gap states.  \n- **Metal cation supplementation**: Metal salts (e.g., PbI₂, SnI₂) provide excess Pb²⁺ or Sn²⁺, compensating for stoichiometric imbalances that create cation vacancies. PbI₂ also acts as a secondary Pb source during annealing, ensuring phase purity.  \n\n### **2.

    "reference_answer": "Iodide-based precursor additives, such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide (FAI), play crucial roles in perovskite solar cells. During crystallization, they provide iodide ions which are essential for the formation of the perovskite crystal lattice. They help in controlling the crystal growth rate and orientation, leading to more uniform and well-defined perovskite films. In terms of defect passivation, iodide ions can react with metal cations (e.g., Pb²⁺) at defect sites, reducing the concentration of non-radiative recombination centers. This results in improved charge carrier mobility and extraction efficiency, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Additionally, the presence of iodide-based additives can improve the stability of perovskite films by forming stronger chemical bonds within the perovskite structure, reducing the likelihood of degradation due to environmental factors such as moisture and oxygen exposure.",
    "model_output": "Iodide-based precursor additives modulate the crystallization kinetics and defect landscape of perovskite films through interfacial and stoichiometric mechanisms, directly influencing optoelectronic performance and stability. Here is a structured explanation:\n\n### **1. Crystallization Mechanism**  \nIodide additives (e.g., excess PbI₂ or MAI) in the precursor solution slow nucleation by delaying the onset of perovskite formation during spin-coating or anti-solvent quenching. This occurs because excess iodide ions (I⁻) compete with the organic cation (e.g., MA⁺) for reaction with Pb²⁺, temporarily suppressing the MA-Pb-I stoichiometric ratio required for nucleation. The delayed nucleation reduces the density of nucleation sites, favoring **large-grained microstructures** with fewer grain boundaries. Concurrently, iodide ions act as a \"solubility buffer,\" stabilizing intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂) during annealing, which prolongs the growth phase and promotes **columnar grain alignment** perpendicular to the substrate. This results in smoother, pinhole-free films with reduced trap-state density at grain boundaries.\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation Mechanism**  \nIodide additives mitigate intrinsic defects in three ways:  \n- **Lattice Incorporation**: Excess I⁻ compensates for Pb vacancies (Pbₐₐ), a major non-radiative recombination center. Iodide ions substitute into the lattice at Pb-deficient sites, forming **I-Pb-I dimers** that restore charge neutrality and reduce defect-mediated recombination.  \n- **Surface Passivation**: Excess iodide adsorbs onto undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites at the perovskite surface, passivating dangling bonds and suppressing interfacial defects (e.g., at the hole-transport layer).  \n- **Phase Stabilization**: By maintaining stoichiometric excess of I⁻, additives suppress the formation of metastable phases (e.g., δ-phase PbI₂) that degrade charge transport.  \n\n### **3. Impact on Performance and Stability**  \n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)**: The combined effects of reduced non-radiative recombination (via defect passivation), enhanced charge carrier mobility (via large-grained morphology), and suppressed interfacial recombination lead to higher **open-circuit voltage (Voc)** and **fill factor (FF)**. For example, iodide-rich films exhibit reduced trap densities (<10¹⁶ cm⁻³), enabling Voc接近热力学极限 (~1.23 V for MAPbI₃).  \n- **Stability**: While iodide additives improve initial film quality, long-term stability depends on halide distribution. Excess iodide can exacerbate **halide segregation** under operational stress (e.g., moisture, heat), leading to phase instability and ion migration. However, moderate iodide concentrations stabilize the perovskite lattice against Pb-I bond dissociation, delaying degradation. Devices with optimal iodide content often exhibit enhanced operational stability (e.g., >1,000 hours at max power) due to reduced defect-induced degradation pathways.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nIodide additives enhance PCE by optimizing crystallization dynamics and passivating intrinsic defects but require careful tuning to balance phase stability and halide distribution. Their effectiveness hinges on precursor stoichiometry and processing conditions, underscoring the need for precise additive engineering to achieve both high efficiency and durability in perovskite solar cells.",

FA⁺’s larger size and polarizability enhance lattice flexibility, reducing strain and stabilizing the cubic structure.  \n2. **Defect Passivation**:  \n   - **Iodine Vacancies (V_I)**: Excess I⁻ from FAI compensates for iodine vacancies, which are major non-radiative recombination centers.  \n   - **A-Site Vacancies**: FA⁺ substitution at the A-site reduces vacancies, which can act as electron traps.  \n   - **Pb-I Framework Stability**: FA⁺’s stronger interaction with Pb-I bonds mitigates Pb interstitial defects and halide segregation.  \n3. **Crystallization Control**: FAI slows nucleation kinetics, favoring homogeneous nucleation and oriented crystal growth. It modulates precursor solution viscosity and polarity, delaying crystallization and enabling larger, more uniform grains.  \n\n---\n\n**Effects on Photovoltaic Performance (PCE)**  \n- **Enhanced Charge Transport**: Reduced defects and larger grain sizes (1–3 μm) minimize interfacial recombination and improve carrier mobility, boosting open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n- **Reduced Hysteresis**: FA-rich perovskites exhibit lower ion migration due to stronger FA⁺-Pb interactions, improving reproducibility and PCE stability under operational conditions.  \n\n---\n\n**Impact on Stability**  \n- **Thermal and Moisture Stability**: The α-phase’s robustness and FA⁺’s steric hindrance reduce susceptibility to decomposition and ion migration. FAI-containing films degrade slower under heat and humidity compared to MA-rich analogs.  \n- **Long-Term Operational Stability**: Suppression of halide segregation and defect-related degradation pathways extends device lifetimes under continuous illumination.  \n\n---\n\n**Crystallization Dynamics**  \nFAI slows precursor solution crystallization by:  \n- **Kinetic Control**: Lowering nucleation rates to favor epitaxial growth over random nucleation.  \n- **Phase Purity**: Minimizing phase segregation in mixed-cation (e.g., FA-MA) systems, which is critical for high-efficiency (>25%) perovskite solar cells.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**  \nFAI functions as a dual-purpose additive: it stabilizes the perovskite phase, passivates critical defects, and modulates crystallization to optimize film morphology. These effects synergistically enhance PCE (up to ~26% in state-of-the-art devices) and stability, making FAI indispensable in high-performance perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts, such as formamidinium iodide (FAI) or cesium iodide (CsI), when introduced as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells, enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE) through multiple defect passivation and crystallization mechanisms. Below is a structured explanation of the underlying processes:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation via Vacancy Filling and Charge Compensation**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃) inherently contain defects such as Pb vacancies (V_Pb²⁺) and iodine vacancies (V_I⁻), which act as non-radiative recombination centers. Organic ammonium cations (e.g., FA⁺, MA⁺) from additives can:  \n- **Substitute into Pb vacancies**: The ammonium cations occupy V_Pb²⁺ sites, neutralizing the charge imbalance and eliminating deep-level traps that would otherwise localize electrons or holes.  \n- **Compensate halide vacancies**: In cases of halide deficiency (V_I⁻), the additive’s halide counterions (e.g., I⁻ from FAI) replenish stoichiometry, reducing p-type defects.  \nThis dual action reduces trap densities, lowering non-radiative recombination and improving open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Mixed-Cation Alloying and Lattice Strain Stabilization**  \nWhen additives introduce secondary organic cations (e.g., FA⁺ in MA-based perovskites), they form mixed-cation alloys (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃). The mismatch in cation sizes (e.g., FA⁺ > MA⁺) induces **lattice strain**, which:  \n- **Pins defects**: Strain energy barriers hinder defect migration, trapping them in low-energy configurations that are less detrimental to charge transport.  \n- **Suppresses phase segregation**: The mixed cations stabilize the perovskite phase against decomposition into secondary phases (e.g., PbI₂), which are rich in defects.  \nThis enhances carrier lifetime and reduces interfacial recombination at grain boundaries.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \nAdditives slow nucleation and growth rates during film formation, leading to:  \n- **Larger grain sizes**: Reduced nucleation sites and slower growth promote fewer grain boundaries, which are common defect accumulation sites.  \n- **Improved stoichiometry**: Prolonged crystallization allows for more complete conversion of PbI₂ precursors, minimizing composition fluctuations that generate defects.  \nThe resulting dense, pinhole-free films exhibit enhanced charge-carrier diffusion lengths and reduced series resistance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Surface Passivation**  \nOrganic ammonium cations can adsorb onto perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries, passivating surface defects (e.g., undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or dangling bonds). This:  \n- **Reduces surface recombination**: Passivation blocks trap states that would otherwise capture carriers, improving Voc.  \n- **Enhances interfacial compatibility**: The additive may form a protective layer at the perovskite/charge-transport layer interface, reducing energy barriers for carrier extraction and boosting short-circuit current (Jsc).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Suppression of Ionic Defect Migration**  \nIn mixed-cation systems, the larger organic cations (e.g., FA⁺) impede the migration of mobile ions (e.g., I⁻), which can form conductive filaments or induce hysteresis. This stabilizes the perovskite structure under operational conditions, maintaining long-term performance.\n\n---\n\n### **Resulting Influence on Device Performance**  \nThese mechanisms collectively lead to:  \n- **Reduced non-radiative recombination** (enhanced Voc and FF).  \n- **Improved charge-carrier mobility** (increased Jsc).  \n- **Enhanced film homogeneity** (reduced interfacial and bulk defects).  \n- **Stabilized phase and structure** (longer operational lifetime).  \n\nBy addressing defects at multiple scales—from atomic-scale vacancies to mesoscale grain boundaries—organic ammonium additives optimize optoelectronic properties, directly translating to higher PCE in perovskite solar cells.",

    "reference_answer": "Organic acids like oleic acid act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by coordinating with metal ions in the precursor solution. They form stable complexes with metal cations, which can influence the crystallization kinetics. During the film formation process, these complexes can slow down the nucleation rate and promote the growth of well - ordered perovskite crystals. This leads to a more uniform and high - quality perovskite film morphology. As a result, the charge carrier mobility is improved, recombination losses are reduced, and ultimately the device performance, such as power conversion efficiency (PCE), is enhanced.",
    "model_output": "Organic acids such as oleic acid function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by modulating the crystallization kinetics and passivating defects through specific chemical interactions. Here is the mechanism and its effects:\n\n### **1. Coordination with Pb²⁺ Ions and Kinetic Control**  \nOleic acid (OA) contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a long aliphatic chain. The carboxylate group forms coordination complexes with Pb²⁺ ions in the precursor solution (e.g., PbI₂). This interaction slows nucleation by sequestering Pb²⁺, delaying the onset of perovskite formation. The aliphatic chain, meanwhile, sterically hinders aggregation of nascent crystals. By decelerating nucleation while allowing growth of existing nuclei, OA promotes **large-grained, uniform crystallization**. This reduces defect densities (e.g., Pb vacancies, interfacial traps) and minimizes grain boundary formation, which are detrimental to charge transport.\n\n### **2. Passivation of Defects and Surface Traps**  \nDuring crystallization, OA’s carboxylate groups can bind to undercoordinated Pb sites at crystal surfaces or defects, neutralizing charge-trapping states. The hydrophobic aliphatic chains may also physically block ion migration pathways or passivate grain boundaries, reducing non-radiative recombination. This defect passivation enhances **minority carrier lifetime** and **charge carrier mobility**, improving open-circuit voltage (\\(V_{\\text{oc}}\\)) and fill factor (\\(FF\\)).\n\n### **3. Influence on Film Morphology and Phase Purity**  \nOA’s steric hindrance and coordination effects suppress the formation of non-perovskite phases (e.g., δ-phase PbI₂) by stabilizing the desired α-phase perovskite. The resulting films exhibit **smooth surfaces**, **reduced pinholes**, and **enhanced crystallinity**, which optimize light absorption and carrier collection. The suppressed ion migration also improves operational stability under thermal or photonic stress.\n\n### **Resulting Device Performance**  \n- **Efficiency**: Higher \\(V_{\\text{oc}}\\) (due to reduced defects), increased short-circuit current (\\(J_{\\text{sc}}\\)) from better light harvesting, and improved \\(FF\\) from reduced recombination.  \n- **Stability**: Reduced ion migration and defect passivation mitigate degradation pathways, prolonging device lifetime.  \n\nIn summary, oleic acid acts as a dual-functional additive: it kinetically steers crystallization toward high-quality films and chemically passivates defects, synergistically enhancing optoelectronic performance and stability in perovskite solar cells.",

    "reference_answer": "Organic cations such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by influencing the crystallization process and film morphology. MA and FA ions can replace the divalent cations in the perovskite lattice, which affects the crystal structure and grain size. This modification leads to improved charge transport properties, reduced defect states, and enhanced device performance. In terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE), the presence of these cations can increase the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, thus boosting the overall PCE. Regarding stability, the formation of more stable perovskite structures with these cations can enhance the long-term stability of the perovskite solar cells under various operating conditions.",
    "model_output": "Organic cations such as methylammonium (MA⁺) and formamidinium (FA⁺) function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by modulating crystallization kinetics, passivating defects, and stabilizing the perovskite phase, thereby enhancing both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. Their roles are rooted in their distinct ionic sizes, polarizabilities, and interactions with the perovskite lattice.\n\n### **1. Crystallization Kinetics and Film Morphology**  \nWhen introduced as additives in precursor solutions (e.g., in MA/PbI₂ or FA/MA mixed systems), these cations slow nucleation and promote controlled crystal growth. FA⁺, with its smaller ionic radius (0.46 Å vs. MA⁺’s 0.52 Å), preferentially occupies the A-site lattice, forming mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA<sub>x</sub>MA<sub>1−x</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>). This size mismatch induces strain in the lattice, which suppresses non-equilibrium phase formation (e.g., δ-phase stabilization) and reduces defect nucleation sites. The slower kinetics enable larger grain formation (micrometer-scale), minimizing grain boundary density. Fewer grain boundaries reduce non-radiative recombination pathways, improving charge carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>).\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \nBoth cations mitigate intrinsic defects in the perovskite lattice. Iodine vacancies (V<sub>I</sub><sup>••</sup>), a major source of deep-level traps, are passivated by the cations’ polarizability. FA⁺’s electron-rich amidinium group enhances electron delocalization, reducing the formation energy of V<sub>I</sub><sup>••</sup>. Additionally, excess MA⁺ or FA⁺ in the precursor can act as surface ligands, capping undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at crystal facets during growth. This passivation reduces trap states, lowering dark current and improving fill factor (FF).\n\n### **3. Phase Stability and Environmental Resistance**  \nFA-rich compositions stabilize the perovskite phase under thermal and moisture stress. The smaller FA⁺ cation compresses the lattice, increasing the activation energy for phase transitions (e.g., α→δ phase shift) and iodide vacancy migration. Mixed-cation systems also suppress ion migration (e.g., Pb-I diffusion) under operational bias, mitigating hysteresis and long-term degradation. The δ-phase (FA-dominant) exhibits superior humidity resistance compared to the α-phase (MA-dominant), enhancing device stability under ambient conditions.\n\n### **Impact on Performance**  \n- **PCE**: Mixed-cation systems (e.g., FA:MA ratios ~60:40) optimize the bandgap (~1.5 eV) for balanced absorption and voltage, achieving PCEs exceeding 25% in state-of-the-art devices. Reduced non-radiative losses improve V<sub>oc</sub> and FF.  \n- **Stability**: FA’s role in lattice compression and phase stabilization delays decomposition, extending operational lifetimes under continuous illumination and elevated temperatures.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nMA and FA additives synergistically enhance PSC performance by controlling crystallization, passivating defects, and stabilizing the perovskite phase. Their combined use optimizes optoelectronic properties while addressing degradation mechanisms, making them critical for high-efficiency, durable PSCs.",

Additionally, better defect passivation and controlled crystallization can contribute to the stability of the perovskite solar cells by reducing trap states and improving the film morphology.",
    "model_output": "**Chemical Mechanisms of LiI and DMSO in Perovskite Solar Cells**  \n\n### **1. Lithium Iodide (LiI): Defect Passivation and Structural Stabilization**  \n**Defect Passivation:**  \nLiI introduces Li⁺ cations and excess I⁻ anions into the perovskite lattice. Li⁺, with a smaller ionic radius (0.76 Å) than MA⁺ (1.47 Å), substitutes for MA⁺ in the A-site of the perovskite (e.g., in MAPbI₃), occupying interstitial or substitutional sites. This substitution mitigates MA⁺ vacancies, a common defect that creates deep-level traps for charge carriers.

Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO): Crystallization Kinetics and Morphology Control**  \n**Crystallization Mechanism:**  \nDMSO acts as a solvent additive in the precursor solution, slowing the evaporation rate of the primary solvent (e.g., DMF or DMSO itself). This prolonged solvent drying process delays nucleation and promotes Ostwald ripening, enabling larger, more uniform perovskite grains to form.

This coordination also modulates ion transport, allowing Pb²⁺ and halide ions to arrange into a more ordered lattice during phase transition.  \n\n**Defect Reduction:**  \nBy promoting large-grained films with fewer grain boundaries, DMSO reduces recombination sites at interfaces. Additionally, DMSO may suppress Pb interstitial defects by stabilizing the Pb-I coordination network during crystallization.  \n\n### **Combined Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE):**  \n  - **LiI** reduces non-radiative recombination via defect passivation, improving open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n  - **DMSO** enhances charge carrier mobility and reduces series resistance by improving grain size and film homogeneity, boosting short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF.  \n  - Together, these effects synergistically elevate PCE by optimizing all key photovoltaic parameters.  \n\n- **Stability:**  \n  - LiI’s structural stabilization delays phase degradation and moisture-induced decomposition, prolonging operational lifetime.  \n  - DMSO’s grain refinement reduces surface-area-dependent degradation pathways (e.g., ion migration at grain boundaries), further enhancing stability under environmental stress.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nLiI and DMSO function via distinct yet complementary mechanisms: LiI passivates intrinsic defects and stabilizes the perovskite lattice, while DMSO controls crystallization kinetics to optimize morphology.

    "model_output": "Formamidinium bromide (FABr) functions as a precursor additive in perovskite solar cells by modulating the crystallization kinetics and defect chemistry of the perovskite film, primarily through cation/anion substitution and lattice strain engineering. Here is the mechanism and its effects:\n\n### **1. Chemical Mechanism: Cation/Anion Substitution**\nFABr dissociates into formamidinium (FA⁺) and bromide (Br⁻) ions in the precursor solution. These ions substitute for methylammonium (MA⁺) and iodide (I⁻) in the perovskite lattice, forming mixed-cation (FA/MA) and mixed-anion (I/Br) perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈₃MA₀.₁₇Pb(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁₇)₃). The larger ionic radius of FA⁺ (compared to MA⁺) and the smaller radius of Br⁻ (compared to I⁻) introduce lattice strain, which slows nucleation and crystal growth rates.

Influence on Crystallization Dynamics**\n- **Kinetic Effects**: The mixed-cation/anion composition increases the complexity of ion diffusion and lattice coordination, delaying phase separation and promoting homogeneous nucleation. This results in fewer defects (e.g., iodide vacancies, interfacial traps) and a more ordered crystal structure.\n- **Defect Passivation**: Bromide incorporation suppresses iodide vacancy formation (a major source of non-radiative recombination) by stabilizing the anion sublattice. FA⁺’s steric hindrance also mitigates ion migration and structural instability, particularly under operational stress.\n\n### **3. Film Quality and Device Performance**\n- **Morphological Improvement**: Slower crystallization yields pinhole-free, dense films with enhanced surface coverage and grain boundaries. Larger grains reduce recombination losses at grain boundaries, improving charge carrier diffusion lengths.\n- **Optoelectronic Tuning**: Br substitution narrows the bandgap slightly (compared to pure MAPbI₃), optimizing light absorption in the visible range.

    "model_output": "The mechanism by which formamidinium iodide (FAI)-based perovskite precursor additives containing organic cations like N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) enhance defect passivation and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells involves synergistic chemical and structural interactions during film formation. Below is a structured explanation:\n\n---\n\n### **Underlying Chemical/Physical Mechanism**  \n1. **Defect Passivation via Cation Substitution and Surface Adsorption**:  \n   - FAI introduces formamidinium (FA⁺) cations into the perovskite lattice, which can substitute for smaller organic cations (e.g., methylammonium, MA⁺) or occupy interstitial sites. This substitution reduces lattice strain and stabilizes the perovskite structure, minimizing intrinsic defects such as iodine vacancies (VI⁻) and Pb interstitials (Pb²⁺).  \n   - Organic cations like DMF act as surface passivators. They adsorb onto undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites at grain boundaries or surfaces, neutralizing trap states that would otherwise act as recombination centers.  \n\n2. **Controlled Crystallization Kinetics**:  \n   - DMF and FAI slow nucleation and growth rates during perovskite film formation. This allows for more ordered crystal growth, reducing defect density and promoting large grain formation. The organic cations may coordinate with Pb²⁺ ions in the precursor solution, delaying nucleation and enabling kinetically favorable crystallographic orientations.  \n\n3. **Optimization of Morphology and Composition**:  \n   - FAI promotes the formation of mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA/MA/Pb/I), which exhibit enhanced stability and reduced ion migration compared to single-cation analogs. The larger FA⁺ cation also improves tolerance to structural distortions, suppressing phase segregation.  \n   - DMF may act as a solvent additive, modulating precursor viscosity and solvent evaporation dynamics to improve film uniformity and pinhole-free coverage.  \n\n---\n\n### **Interaction with Components/Defects**  \n- **Defect Neutralization**:  \n  - FA⁺ cations fill VI⁻ sites, which are major non-radiative recombination centers. By occupying these sites, FA⁺ reduces midgap states and suppresses bimolecular recombination.  \n  - DMF molecules bind to Pb²⁺-rich regions at surfaces/grain boundaries, passivating dangling bonds and reducing trap-assisted recombination.  \n\n- **Lattice Stabilization**:  \n  - FA⁺ substitution into the perovskite lattice reduces lattice mismatch strain between adjacent grains, minimizing structural defects such as dislocations.  \n  - DMF’s steric hindrance may inhibit the formation of PbI₂-rich domains, which are detrimental to optoelectronic performance.  \n\n---\n\n### **Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n1. **Film Quality**:  \n   - **Reduced Defect Density**: Passivation of VI⁻ and Pb interstitials lowers the density of deep-level traps, improving minority carrier lifetime.  \n   - **Enhanced Crystallinity**: Slower crystallization promotes larger, more uniform grains with fewer grain boundaries, reducing recombination pathways.  \n   - **Improved Morphology**: DMF’s role in solvent engineering yields smoother, pinhole-free films with better light absorption and charge transport pathways.  \n\n2. **Device Performance**:  \n   - **Increased Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc)**: Reduced non-radiative recombination (via defect passivation) allows carriers to reach electrodes, maximizing Voc.  \n   - **Higher Fill Factor (FF)**: Reduced interfacial and bulk recombination improves charge extraction efficiency, boosting FF.  \n   - **Enhanced Light Absorption**: Optimal bandgap tuning (via FA/MA mixing) and reduced scattering (via large grains) increase short-circuit current density (Jsc).  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nFAI and DMF additives synergistically improve perovskite film quality by suppressing defect formation, stabilizing the lattice, and optimizing crystallization dynamics. These effects directly translate to reduced recombination losses and enhanced charge transport, enabling higher PCE through improved Voc, Jsc, and FF. The mechanism underscores the importance of cation engineering and solvent-additive interactions in advancing perovskite photovoltaic technology.",

    "reference_answer": "Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) differ in their chemical nature with FAI having a formamidinium cation and MAI having a methylammonium cation.

    "model_output": "### Key Differences in Chemical Nature and Defect Passivation Mechanisms of FAI and MAI in Perovskite Solar Cells  \n\n#### **1. Chemical Nature and Structural Role**  \n- **Formamidinium Iodide (FAI):**  \n  - **Cation Size and Electronic Structure:** The FA⁺ cation (CH(NH₂)₂⁺) is larger (ionic radius ~0.53 Å) and more electron-donating than MA⁺. Its delocalized π-conjugated structure enhances electron delocalization, reducing the bandgap of the perovskite (e.g., ~1.5 eV for FA-based perovskites).  \n  - **Lattice Compatibility:** FA⁺ preferentially occupies the A-site in the perovskite lattice (ABX₃), promoting the formation of mixed-phase (e.g., α/δ) or cubic phases, which are optically favorable but prone to phase segregation under thermal or environmental stress.  \n\n- **Methylammonium Iodide (MAI):**  \n  - **Cation Size and Electronic Structure:** The MA⁺ cation (CH₃NH₃⁺) is smaller (ionic radius ~0.45 Å) and weaker electron-donor compared to FA⁺, yielding a wider bandgap (~1.6 eV for pure MA-based perovskites).  \n  - **Lattice Compatibility:** MA⁺ stabilizes the cubic phase at room temperature but forms more stable orthorhombic phases under thermal stress, which exhibit inferior charge transport but enhanced thermal stability.  \n\n#### **2. Defect Passivation Mechanisms**  \n- **FAI:**  \n  - **Iodine Vacancy (VI) Passivation:** FA⁺’s larger size and stronger interaction with iodide (I⁻) counterions suppress iodine vacancy formation. FA⁺ can substitute for missing I⁻ in the lattice, reducing mid-gap states that trap charge carriers.  \n  - **Surface Passivation:** FA⁺ forms stronger hydrogen bonds with surface halide ions, passivating surface defects and reducing non-radiative recombination at grain boundaries.  \n  - **Phase Stabilization:** FA⁺ mitigates phase segregation by stabilizing the mixed-phase structure, though prolonged exposure to moisture or heat can induce δ-phase dominance, introducing new defects.  \n\n- **MAI:**  \n  - **Lead Vacancy (VLi) Passivation:** MA⁺’s smaller size allows it to fill lead vacancies more effectively, particularly in the orthorhombic phase, reducing deep-level traps.  \n  - **Surface Passivation:** MA⁺ passivates surface defects via weaker hydrogen bonding, which is less effective than FA⁺ but still reduces surface recombination.  \n  - **Thermal Stability:** MA⁺ stabilizes the orthorhombic phase, which resists thermal degradation but is susceptible to moisture-induced decomposition.  \n\n#### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality:**  \n  - **FAI:** Promotes slower crystallization kinetics, enabling larger, pinhole-free grains with reduced defect density. However, phase instability under environmental stress can lead to microstructural degradation.  \n  - **MAI:** Facilitates faster crystallization, often resulting in smaller grains with higher defect density but better thermal stability.  \n\n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE):**  \n  - **FAI:** The narrower bandgap and reduced non-radiative recombination enhance light absorption and charge-carrier lifetime, boosting PCE (up to ~25% in state-of-the-art devices). However, phase instability can cause efficiency degradation over time.  \n  - **MAI:** Wider bandgap and higher surface recombination limit PCE (typically ~22–23%), but its thermal stability maintains efficiency under prolonged operation.  \n\n- **Stability:**  \n  - **FAI:** Prone to moisture-induced δ-phase formation and halide segregation, leading to rapid performance degradation in humid environments.  \n  - **MAI:** Resistant to thermal degradation but vulnerable to moisture and UV-induced decomposition, causing slower but persistent efficiency loss.  \n\n#### **Synergistic Effects in Mixed Cation Systems**  \nBlending FAI and MAI (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃) optimizes performance by balancing FA⁺’s optoelectronic benefits with MA⁺’s stability. The mixed cation system suppresses phase segregation, reduces defect densities, and enhances environmental stability, achieving high PCE (~25.7%) with improved operational lifetimes.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nFAI and MAI differ fundamentally in their structural roles, defect passivation strategies, and stability trade-offs. FAI enhances optoelectronic performance via defect passivation and bandgap tuning but suffers from phase instability, while MAI provides superior thermal stability at the cost of lower PCE. Their combined use in mixed-cation perovskites represents a critical advancement in achieving high-efficiency, durable solar cells.",

    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts, such as formamidinium iodide (FAS) or cesium iodide (CsI), function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells through a combination of **crystallization modulation** and **defect passivation**, directly influencing film morphology and optoelectronic performance. Here is the mechanism and its implications:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Chemical Mechanism: Crystallization Modulation**  \nOrganic ammonium salts act as **co-precursors** during perovskite film formation. When added to the precursor solution (e.g., MAI/PbI₂), the ammonium cations (e.g., FA⁺, Cs⁺) compete with the primary cations (e.g., MA⁺) for incorporation into the perovskite lattice. This introduces **mixed-cation alloying** (e.g., FA/MA/PbI₃), altering the crystallization kinetics:  \n- **Delayed nucleation**: The additive cations form **intermediate complexes** with lead halides (e.g., FA⁺·PbI₆⁴⁻), slowing perovskite nucleation. This extended nucleation period reduces defect-rich, non-equilibrium crystallites.  \n- **Kinetic pathway control**: The additives steer the solution-phase reaction toward **layer-by-layer growth**, promoting larger, more uniform grains with fewer grain boundaries.

Defect Passivation Mechanism**  \nPerovskites inherently suffer from intrinsic defects (e.g., iodine vacancies, Pb interstitials) that act as non-radiative recombination centers. Organic ammonium additives mitigate these defects via two pathways:  \n- **Cation substitution**: Mixed-cation alloying fills vacancies in the ABX₃ lattice. For example, FA⁺ substitution for MA⁺ in MAPbI₃ reduces **iodine vacancy (V_I) formation energy**, as FA⁺ has a stronger binding affinity to Pb²⁺, stabilizing the lattice and suppressing V_I-related defects.  \n- **Surface passivation**: Excess additive cations or their organic moieties (e.g., formamidinium’s NH₂ groups) adsorb onto perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. These groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or I⁻ sites, passivating surface defects and reducing **trap states** that trap charge carriers.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film morphology**: The additives promote **large-grained, pinhole-free films** with reduced surface roughness, enhancing charge-carrier diffusion lengths and reducing interfacial recombination.  \n- **Optoelectronic properties**: Defect passivation reduces **non-radiative recombination**, elevating open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Mixed-cation alloying also stabilizes the perovskite phase (e.g., suppressing α/δ phase transitions), improving thermal and operational stability.  \n- **Device performance**: These effects collectively enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE), with Voc gains often being the dominant factor. For instance, FA-based additives in MAPbI₃ films can increase Voc by ~0.1–0.2 V due to reduced defect densities and improved bandgap alignment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nOrganic ammonium salts enhance perovskite solar cell performance by modulating crystallization dynamics to improve film quality and directly passivating intrinsic and surface defects through cation substitution and coordination.

Below is a structured explanation of its mechanism:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Influence on Crystallization Process**  \n**Mechanism:**  \nFAI slows nucleation and promotes controlled crystal growth during perovskite film formation. Its lower solubility in common precursor solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide, DMF) compared to methylammonium iodide (MAI) creates a kinetic bottleneck in the reaction kinetics of the precursor solution. This delay in nucleation allows for prolonged ion diffusion and ordered cation/anion arrangement, favoring the formation of large, uniform grains with fewer defects.  \n\n**Interaction with Components:**  \nFAI competes with MAI for incorporation into the perovskite lattice (ABX₃ structure, where A = FA/MA, B = Pb, X = I). The larger size of FA⁺ (vs. MA⁺) and its stronger interaction with PbI₆ octahedra slow the precipitation of PbI₂, enabling extended crystallization time. This results in a mixed-cation (FA/MA) alloyed perovskite phase (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃), which exhibits a more robust α-phase structure.  \n\n**Resulting Film Quality:**  \nThe delayed nucleation and extended growth kinetics produce dense, pinhole-free films with reduced grain boundaries and fewer surface defects. Larger grain sizes (typically >1 µm) minimize recombination sites at grain boundaries, improving charge transport.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \n**Mechanism:**  \nFAI mitigates intrinsic defects such as iodine vacancies (V_I) and undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites, which act as non-radiative recombination centers. The FA⁺ cation, with its larger ionic radius (0.145 nm vs. 0.136 nm for MA⁺), preferentially occupies interstitial sites or substitutes into the A-site lattice, filling vacancies and passivating defects.  \n\n**Interaction with Defects:**  \n- **Iodine Vacancy Passivation:** FA⁺ insertion into the A-site reduces the driving force for V_I formation, as FA⁺ stabilizes the PbI₆ octahedra through stronger electrostatic interactions.  \n- **Charge Carrier Trapping:** FAI’s incorporation suppresses mid-gap states arising from Pb-I coordination defects, lowering trap densities and reducing recombination losses.  \n\n**Resulting Performance Impact:**  \nReduced defect density enhances open-circuit voltage (Voc) by minimizing non-radiative recombination and improves fill factor (FF) via better charge collection efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Impact on Stability and PCE**  \n**Mechanism:**  \nThe FA⁺-enriched α-phase perovskite exhibits superior structural stability due to stronger A-site cation-ligand interactions and reduced sensitivity to moisture and temperature. FAI also suppresses phase segregation and hysteresis by stabilizing the mixed-cation composition.  \n\n**Stability Enhancement:**  \n- **Hygroscopic Resistance:** FAI’s larger cations and stronger bonding reduce lattice strain, delaying decomposition in humid environments.  \n- **Thermal Stability:** The α-phase’s higher symmetry and FA⁺-induced lattice strain stabilize the perovskite against thermal degradation.  \n\n**PCE Improvement:**  \nThe combined effects of enhanced crystallinity, reduced recombination, and improved stability lead to higher PCE (via increased Voc, Jsc, and FF) and prolonged operational lifetime. FAI-doped perovskites often achieve PCEs exceeding 25% in state-of-the-art devices, with stability improvements over 1000 hours under continuous illumination.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**  \nFAI acts as a dual-functional additive by (1) kinetically controlling crystallization to optimize grain morphology, (2) passivating electronic defects through cation substitution, and (3) stabilizing the perovskite lattice against environmental degradation.

The mechanism operates via the following interrelated pathways:\n\n### 1. **Defect Passivation via Iodide Compensation and Lattice Incorporation**  \n   - **Iodine Vacancy Filling**: Perovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃ or FAPbI₃) often exhibit iodine vacancies (VI), which act as electron traps and promote non-radiative recombination. FAI and MAI provide excess iodide ions (I⁻) during crystallization, which compensate for VI defects. The iodide ions occupy vacant sites in the perovskite lattice, reducing midgap states and suppressing carrier recombination.  \n   - **Cationic Substitution**: The organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) can substitute for Pb²⁺ cations in the lattice or intercalate between perovskite layers. This substitution reduces Pb vacancies and stabilizes the crystal structure, particularly at grain boundaries and surfaces, where defect densities are highest.  \n\n### 2. **Controlled Crystallization and Grain Growth**  \n   - **Kinetic Modulation**: FAI and MAI act as surfactants, slowing nucleation and promoting anisotropic crystal growth. This reduces the density of grain boundaries and defects formed during rapid precipitation. Larger, more ordered grains minimize recombination pathways and improve charge carrier diffusion lengths.  \n   - **Phase Stabilization**: The mixed cation composition (e.g., FA⁺/MA⁺) modulates the perovskite phase stability. FAI-rich regions (higher bandgap) and MAI-rich regions (lower bandgap) form a compositional gradient that suppresses phase segregation and associated interfacial defects. This gradient also broadens the absorption spectrum, enhancing light harvesting.  \n\n### 3. **Surface Passivation and Interface Engineering**  \n   - **Surface Adsorption**: Excess FA⁺ and MA⁺ ions adsorb onto perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries, passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites. These sites are prone to forming trap states with oxygen or moisture; cation adsorption blocks such interactions, reducing surface recombination.  \n   - **Interfacial Compatibility**: The organic cations improve the perovskite/electron/hole transport layer interfaces by reducing energy barriers and defect-mediated leakage currents.  \n\n### **Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Reduced Non-Radiative Recombination**: Defect passivation lowers midgap trap densities, extending carrier lifetimes and improving open-circuit voltage (Voc).  \n- **Enhanced Charge Transport**: Larger, fewer-defect grains increase carrier mobility and fill factor (FF).  \n- **Stability Improvements**: Mixed-cation perovskites exhibit reduced halide segregation and moisture sensitivity, prolonging operational stability.  \n\nIn summary, FAI and MAI additives synergistically suppress intrinsic defects, optimize crystallinity, and stabilize the perovskite structure, directly translating to higher PCE through reduced recombination losses and improved optoelectronic properties.",

    "reference_answer": "Formamidinium cations provided by formamidinium iodide (FAI) participate in the formation of the perovskite lattice structure, influencing the crystallization process by promoting the growth of well-defined perovskite grains, leading to a more ordered and defect-free perovskite film, which enhances charge carrier mobility and collection efficiency, improving device performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability.",
    "model_output": "Formamidinium cations (FA⁺) introduced via formamidinium iodide (FAI) play a critical role in stabilizing the perovskite lattice structure and enhancing optoelectronic performance in solar cells through several interrelated mechanisms:\n\n### 1. **Structural Stabilization via Lattice Parameter Tuning**  \nFA⁺ (diameter ≈ 5.5 Å) is larger and more planar than methylammonium (MA⁺, ≈4.4 Å) but smaller than cesium (Cs⁺, ≈5.8 Å). In mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃), FA⁺ occupies the A-site, expanding the perovskite lattice along the **\\[001\\]** direction. This expansion reduces the octahedral tilt angle of the PbI₆ framework, shifting the structure from a distorted orthorhombic phase (common in MA-based perovskites) toward a more cubic-like configuration. The reduced structural distortion minimizes lattice strain and stabilizes the perovskite against thermally induced phase segregation or decomposition, particularly at elevated temperatures.\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation and Reduced Non-Radiative Recombination**  \nFA⁺’s planar geometry and stronger ion-dipole interactions with PbI₆ octahedra improve the stoichiometric ordering of the perovskite lattice. This reduces iodide vacancies (I⁻ defects), which are major contributors to non-radiative recombination in MA-rich perovskites. Additionally, FA⁺’s larger size better fills the A-site, suppressing undercoordination defects that arise when smaller cations (e.g., MA⁺) leave voids. Fewer defects enhance minority carrier lifetime and reduce trap-state densities, directly improving open-circuit voltage (**Voc**) and fill factor (**FF**).\n\n### 3. **Crystallization Kinetics and Film Morphology**  \nDuring solution-processing, FA⁺ slows nucleation kinetics compared to MA⁺, promoting larger grain growth and fewer grain boundaries. The slower crystallization allows for more ordered 3D perovskite domains, reducing interfacial defects and pinholes. FA’s polar nature also enhances interfacial interactions with precursor solvents (e.g., DMF/DMSO), guiding epitaxial growth and minimizing residual organic residues that degrade charge transport.\n\n### 4. **Optoelectronic Tuning**  \nFA-rich perovskites exhibit a narrower bandgap (~1.45 eV) than MA-based analogs (~1.55 eV), enhancing light absorption in the visible range. The reduced bandgap, combined with suppressed defect-mediated recombination, optimizes the trade-off between light harvesting and voltage retention. FA’s role in stabilizing the hybrid organic-inorganic framework also minimizes halide ion migration under operational conditions, preserving long-term stability.\n\n### **Resulting Influence on Device Performance**  \nThe synergistic effects of FA⁺ incorporation lead to:  \n- **Enhanced crystallinity** (grain sizes >1 µm), reducing recombination losses.  \n- **Improved phase stability** (e.g., suppression of δ-phase formation), extending operational lifetime.  \n- **Optimized optoelectronic properties** (higher **Voc**, reduced trap density), enabling certified power conversion efficiencies exceeding 26%.  \n\nIn summary, FA⁺ stabilizes the perovskite lattice through structural, kinetic, and electronic mechanisms, directly addressing critical failure modes (defects, phase instability) to elevate both the quality of perovskite films and the performance of photovoltaic devices.",

Their effects on crystallization and device performance arise from these mechanistic interactions:\n\n### **Defect Passivation Mechanisms**\n1. **Carboxylate Groups (e.g., formate, acetate):**  \n   Carboxylate anions (e.g., -COO⁻) coordinate with under-coordinated Pb²⁺ cations at surface or bulk defect sites. The oxygen atoms in the carboxylate form strong Pb-O bonds, filling Pb vacancies (e.g., Pb interstitials or vacancies) and blocking iodide (I⁻) vacancies. This reduces trap states that would otherwise act as recombination centers. Additionally, the bidentate coordination of carboxylate groups stabilizes the perovskite framework, preventing lattice distortions.\n\n2. **Amine Groups (e.g., methylamine, dimethylamine):**  \n   Amines (e.g., -NH₂) interact with halide anions (e.g., I⁻) at under-coordinated Pb sites or interstitial voids. The lone-pair electrons on nitrogen form weak coordination bonds with Pb²⁺, passivating Pb vacancies. Amines can also scavenge iodide vacancies by donating electrons or occupying interstitial sites, thereby reducing the density of deep-level traps. Their smaller size allows them to penetrate the perovskite lattice, enabling efficient defect passivation at both surface and bulk interfaces.\n\n3. **Phosphine Groups (e.g., triphenylphosphine):**  \n   Phosphines (e.g., -PH₃) coordinate with Pb²⁺ via phosphorus lone pairs, similar to amines. The bulky organic substituents (e.g., phenyl groups) sterically hinder the formation of defect clusters and interstitial defects during crystallization. This steric stabilization prevents aggregation of Pb vacancies and halide defects, particularly at grain boundaries. The phosphorus-Pb coordination also stabilizes the perovskite phase by reducing structural fluctuations.\n\n### **Effects on Crystallization**\n- **Kinetic Control:** These additives slow nucleation and crystal growth by adsorbing onto precursor solution surfaces or nascent crystal facets. This prolongs the metastable phase, enabling larger, more uniform grain formation with fewer defects.  \n- **Defect Suppression During Growth:** By passivating nascent defects as they form, additives reduce the nucleation of secondary phases (e.g., α-phase PbI₂) and minimize vacancy-rich regions.  \n- **Grain Boundary Stabilization:** Phosphines and carboxylates can pin grain boundaries, reducing the mobility of defects along these high-energy interfaces.\n\n### **Impact on Device Performance**\n- **Charge Carrier Lifetime:** Reduced trap densities lower non-radiative recombination, increasing open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n- **Charge Transport:** Larger, fewer grains with fewer defects enhance carrier mobility, improving short-circuit current (Jsc) and FF.  \n- **Stability:** Passivation of halide vacancies and Pb interstitials mitigates degradation pathways (e.g., iodide loss, moisture-induced decomposition), enhancing operational stability.  \n- **Reduced Hysteresis:** Fewer interfacial defects stabilize the ferroelectric domain structure, decreasing hysteresis in current-voltage characteristics.\n\n### **Summary**\nCarboxylates, amines, and phosphines passivate defects via coordination bonding, electron donation, and steric stabilization, respectively. These interactions suppress non-radiative recombination and improve crystallinity, leading to enhanced optoelectronic properties (higher Voc, Jsc, FF) and device stability.

    "model_output": "Methylammonium iodide (MAI) plays a multifaceted role in perovskite precursor solutions, influencing crystallization kinetics, defect passivation, and ultimately the optoelectronic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Below is a structured explanation of its mechanisms and effects:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Role in Perovskite Crystallization**  \n**Mechanism:**  \nMAI serves as a stoichiometric source of both methylammonium cations (MA⁺) and iodide anions (I⁻) in precursor solutions, typically mixed with lead iodide (PbI₂) in polar solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide, DMSO). During spin-coating and annealing, MAI modulates the crystallization kinetics through two primary pathways:  \n- **Nucleation and Growth Control:** Excess MAI (beyond stoichiometric ratios) suppresses premature nucleation by delaying the onset of perovskite phase formation. This \"cation-rich\" environment stabilizes intermediate precursor complexes (e.g., MA-Pb-I coordination clusters), prolonging the solution’s supersaturation state. The delayed nucleation promotes slower, more ordered crystal growth, resulting in larger grain sizes and reduced defect densities at grain boundaries.  \n- **Solubility and Phase Evolution:** MAI enhances the solubility of PbI₂ in polar solvents, enabling homogeneous mixing and uniform film formation. During annealing, the excess MAI acts as a \"kinetic stabilizer,\" favoring Ostwald ripening and faceted crystal growth by providing a reservoir of MA⁺ and I⁻ ions to repair defects and guide lattice alignment.  \n\n**Resulting Influence:**  \nThe controlled crystallization kinetics lead to dense, pinhole-free films with high crystallinity and large grain sizes (micrometer-scale), minimizing non-radiative recombination pathways and improving charge transport.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \n**Mechanism:**  \nPerovskite films inherently contain defects such as iodine vacancies (VI), lead vacancies (VL), and interstitial Pb, which act as trap states for charge carriers. MAI mitigates these defects through:  \n- **Iodine Vacancy Filling:** Excess I⁻ from MAI preferentially occupies VI sites, reducing deep-level traps that dominate non-radiative recombination. This is particularly critical in the perovskite surface and grain boundaries, where defect densities are highest.  \n- **MA⁺ Cation Incorporation:** MA⁺ ions can substitute for missing cations in underdoped regions or occupy interstitial sites, passivating dangling bonds and stabilizing the lattice. This reduces mid-gap states and improves the band alignment.  \n\n**Resulting Influence:**  \nDefect passivation enhances open-circuit voltage (Voc) by suppressing recombination losses and improves the minority carrier lifetime, critical for high fill factor (FF) and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Impact on Device Performance (PCE)**  \nThe combined effects of MAI on crystallization and defect passivation directly translate to improved PSC metrics:  \n- **Enhanced Light Absorption and Charge Carrier Mobility:** High-quality, large-grained films exhibit reduced scattering losses and lower trap densities, increasing short-circuit current density (Jsc) and carrier mobility.  \n- **Reduced Hysteresis:** MAI’s role in stabilizing the perovskite structure minimizes ion migration and phase instability, improving reproducibility and operational stability.  \n- **Optimized Bandgap and Band Alignment:** MAI ensures stoichiometric MA/Pb/I ratios, maintaining the desired bandgap (~1.5 eV for MAPbI₃) and preventing mid-gap states that degrade voltage outputs.  \n\n**Quantitative Outcomes:**  \nOptimized MAI concentrations in precursor solutions (e.g., 50–100% excess MAI) correlate with PCEs exceeding 25% in state-of-the-art PSCs, driven by high Voc (>1.15 V), Jsc (>25 mA/cm²), and FF (>80%).  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nMAI functions as both a stoichiometric precursor and a crystallization/defect engineering agent.

Structural and Electronic Differences**  \n- **Cation Size and Lattice Strain**:  \n  FA⁺ (HC(NH₂)₂⁺) is smaller (ionic radius ~0.45 Å) than MA⁺ (CH₃NH₃⁺, ~0.55 Å).

Here is a structured explanation of its mechanism:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Crystallization Influence**  \nLiI modulates the perovskite crystallization kinetics through two primary mechanisms:  \n- **Kinetic Delay and Grain Growth**: When incorporated into precursor solutions, LiI slows the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals by forming stable complexes with PbI₂ and MAI (or FAI) precursors. This delay allows for prolonged ion diffusion and ordered lattice formation, resulting in larger, more uniform grains.

This dopant-induced lattice strain stabilizes the perovskite phase and suppresses phase segregation in mixed-cation systems (e.g., FA/MA/Pb/I), promoting a uniform film morphology.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Defect Passivation Mechanism**  \nLiI mitigates non-radiative recombination by passivating intrinsic defects:  \n- **Iodine Vacancy Passivation**: Iodine vacancies (VI⁻) are the most prevalent defects in perovskites. Each VI⁻ introduces a localized electron trap state. Li⁺ ions neutralize these defects by filling the vacancy sites, eliminating the charge imbalance and suppressing trap-assisted recombination.  \n- **Surface and Grain Boundary Passivation**: At the film surface and grain boundaries, Li⁺ coordinates with undercoordinated halide ions, passivating dangling bonds and reducing surface recombination. This effect is particularly critical for stabilizing the perovskite/metal-halide hole-transport layer interface.  \n- **Suppression of Pb Interstitials**: Li⁺ may also interact with Pb interstitial defects (Pb_i²⁺), which act as electron traps.

Their interactions with the perovskite lattice during crystallization occur through several key mechanisms:\n\n### 1. **Crystallization Kinetics and Grain Growth**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺, when introduced as additives (even at low concentrations), act as surfactants or templating agents during the perovskite nucleation and growth phase. Their organic cations adsorb onto the surfaces of nascent crystallites, reducing surface energy and slowing down the nucleation rate. This delayed nucleation promotes homogeneous nucleation sites and allows for prolonged crystal growth, resulting in larger, more uniform grains. The additives also suppress Ostwald ripening by passivating high-energy grain boundaries, thereby improving film morphology and reducing trap states.\n\n### 2. **Phase Stabilization and Structural Tuning**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺ can substitute into the perovskite lattice (e.g., in mixed-cation compositions like FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃), where their distinct ionic radii (FA⁺: ~0.52 Å; MA⁺: ~0.43 Å) induce lattice strain. FA⁺, being larger, introduces compressive strain that stabilizes the γ-phase (a more stable and optically active form) over the δ-phase (unstable and prone to phase segregation). This strain also suppresses halide ion migration, enhancing thermal and structural stability. MA⁺, when added to FA-rich precursors, can fine-tune the bandgap (via its smaller size) to optimize light absorption while maintaining phase stability.\n\n### 3. **Defect Passivation**  \nBoth cations mitigate intrinsic defects such as iodide vacancies (V_I⁻) and interstitial Pb²⁺, which act as non-radiative recombination centers. FA⁺ and MA⁺ can occupy V_I⁻ sites directly, reducing defect density. Additionally, their polar nature facilitates hydrogen-bonding interactions with undercoordinated halide ions at grain boundaries or surfaces, passivating dangling bonds. This reduces mid-gap states, improving carrier lifetime and charge-carrier mobility.\n\n### 4. **Solution-Processing Effects**  \nIn precursor solutions, FA⁺/MA⁺ additives influence solubility and viscosity, delaying the perovskite reaction kinetics. This extended reaction time allows for more complete conversion of precursors to the perovskite phase, minimizing residual PbI₂ or other non-perovskite phases that degrade performance. The additives also promote a smoother phase transition during annealing, reducing phase segregation and defects.\n\n### Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance  \nThe combined effects of these mechanisms lead to:  \n- **Enhanced Morphology**: Larger grain sizes and fewer pinholes improve charge transport pathways.  \n- **Reduced Defect Density**: Passivation of V_I⁻ and grain boundary traps elevates open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n- **Improved Stability**: Phase stabilization (γ-phase dominance) and suppressed halide migration prolong operational lifetime.  \n- **Optimized Bandgap**: Mixed-cation compositions enable tunable absorption spectra, maximizing light harvesting.  \n\nIn summary, FA⁺ and MA⁺ additives function synergistically during crystallization to control nucleation/growth dynamics, stabilize beneficial phases, and passivate defects, ultimately yielding high-quality perovskite films with superior optoelectronic properties and device performance.",

The extended nucleation delay reduces defect-rich grain boundaries and pinholes, improving film homogeneity and charge-carrier mobility.\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation**  \nHalide vacancies (e.g., VA sites) are common intrinsic defects in perovskites, acting as non-radiative recombination centers. Excess halide additives can occupy these vacancies through post-deposition annealing, reducing trap states. For instance, I⁻ ions can fill iodide vacancies in MAPbI₃, minimizing mid-gap states that degrade open-circuit voltage (Voc) and carrier lifetime. Additionally, halide-rich environments suppress the formation of under-lead vacancies (VPb), which are detrimental to carrier transport.\n\n### 3. **Phase Stabilization**  \nHalide additives influence perovskite phase composition. For example, chloride (Cl⁻) incorporation stabilizes the black (α) phase over metastable δ-phase PbI₂ by substituting into the ABX₃ lattice. This substitution narrows the bandgap and enhances stability against moisture-induced degradation. Similarly, bromide (Br⁻) additives enable compositional grading (e.g., FA/MA mixed-cation and Br/I mixed-halide systems), tuning the bandgap while suppressing phase segregation.\n\n### 4. **Surface and Grain Boundary Engineering**  \nExcess halides can segregate to grain boundaries or film surfaces during crystallization, passivating interfacial defects. Halide-rich regions reduce interfacial trap densities, improving charge extraction efficiency. For instance, Cl⁻ at grain boundaries can suppress non-radiative recombination channels, enhancing fill factor (FF) and Voc.\n\n### **Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \nThese mechanisms collectively result in:  \n- **Enhanced Morphology**: Larger, pinhole-free grains with reduced surface roughness, improving light absorption and charge transport.  \n- **Reduced Defect Density**: Lower non-radiative recombination, evidenced by higher photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and longer carrier lifetimes.  \n- **Improved Stability**: Phase stabilization and defect passivation mitigate degradation pathways (e.g., ion migration, halide loss).  \n- **Optimized Optoelectronics**: Tuned bandgaps and reduced interfacial losses elevate power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability.  \n\nIn summary, halide additives function as kinetic regulators, defect scavengers, and structural stabilizers, synergistically enhancing perovskite film quality and device performance through well-defined chemical and physical interactions during crystallization.",

FA⁺ (formamidinium) has a larger ion radius (≈0.5 Å) compared to MA⁺ (≈0.33 Å), inducing lattice strain in the perovskite framework. FAI’s lower solubility in common precursor solvents (e.g., DMF, DMSO) compared to MAI results in heterogeneous nucleation kinetics.  \n\n**Interaction**:  \nFAI acts as a nucleation inhibitor, slowing crystal growth and promoting defect-free, large-grained films via Ostwald ripening.

    "question": "How do amino - based additives function in perovskite solar cells to passivate defects and improve device performance?",
    "reference_answer": "Amino - based additives passivate defects and enhance device performance by interacting with the perovskite surface. They can form hydrogen bonds or coordinate with specific sites on the perovskite lattice, reducing the density of surface states and trapping centers. This leads to a decrease in non - radiative recombination losses, improved charge carrier mobility, and ultimately an enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells.",
    "model_output": "Amino-based additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance through defect passivation and improved film morphology, mediated by their chemical interactions with perovskite precursors and crystallization dynamics. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation via Coordination and Hydrogen Bonding**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃) commonly exhibit defects such as iodine vacancies (VI⁻) and undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites, which act as electron traps and recombination centers. Amino-based additives (e.g., formamidinium (FA⁺), guanidinium (GA⁺), or organic amines) possess nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., NH₂, NH) that coordinate with Pb²⁺ ions at defect sites. This coordination stabilizes undercoordinated Pb²⁺, reducing the density of trap states within the bandgap. Additionally, the amino groups form hydrogen bonds with residual iodide ions (I⁻) or surface halide species, passivating surface defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. The resulting defect density reduction improves open-circuit voltage (Voc) and charge-carrier lifetime.\n\n### **2. Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \nDuring perovskite film formation, amino additives slow nucleation and growth rates by delaying MAI/PbI₂ precursor mixing. This kinetic control promotes larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries, which are secondary defect sources. The additives may also act as structural templates, guiding epitaxial growth and reducing phase segregation (e.g., between α/δ phases in mixed-cation perovskites). Enhanced crystallinity reduces interfacial recombination and improves charge transport, boosting short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).\n\n### **3. Surface Passivation and Environmental Stability**  \nAmino groups can form a passivating layer at the perovskite surface, blocking moisture and oxygen ingress that degrade the material. The polar nature of amino-functionalized species also reduces surface energy, minimizing pinhole formation during film deposition. This dual effect enhances both operational stability and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), directly correlating with device efficiency retention over time.\n\n### **4. Electronic Structure Tuning**  \nThe incorporation of amino groups (e.g., FA⁺ substituting MA⁺ in the ABX₃ lattice) modulates the bandgap and band-edge alignment. FA’s larger ionic radius induces compressive strain, narrowing the bandgap slightly while elevating the valence band maximum, which improves light absorption and reduces interfacial energy barriers with electron/hole transport layers. This alignment optimization enhances charge extraction efficiency.\n\n### **Resulting Influence on Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: Larger grains, fewer defects, and smoother surfaces reduce recombination losses and non-radiative pathways.  \n- **Device Metrics**: Voc increases due to reduced trap-mediated recombination; Jsc improves via better light absorption and charge collection; FF rises from enhanced carrier mobility and reduced interfacial losses.  \n- **Stability**: Passivation of halide vacancies and surface defects mitigates degradation from ion migration and environmental exposure.  \n\nIn summary, amino-based additives function through synergistic defect passivation, crystallization control, and surface stabilization, collectively optimizing optoelectronic properties and device performance in perovskite solar cells.",

    "model_output": "Organic cation additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) mitigate defects through **substitutional doping**, **surface passivation**, and **structural modulation**, directly influencing charge carrier mobility and recombination dynamics. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation via Substitutional Doping**  \nOrganic cations (e.g., formamidinium (FA⁺), cesium (Cs⁺), or guanidinium (GA⁺)) are incorporated into the perovskite lattice during crystallization, substituting for the primary organic cation (e.g., methylammonium (MA⁺) in MAPbI₃). This substitution:  \n- **Fills stoichiometric vacancies**: Pb²⁺ vacancies and interstitial I⁻ defects are common in perovskites. The charged organic cations (e.g., FA⁺, Cs⁺) neutralize the charge imbalance caused by these defects, suppressing the formation of mid-gap trap states that act as recombination centers.  \n- **Adjusts defect energy levels**: By altering the local electronic structure around defects, additives can push defect levels away from the conduction/valence band edges, reducing their ability to trap charge carriers. For example, FA⁺ substitution in MAPbI₃ shifts defect levels closer to the band edges but stabilizes the perovskite phase, balancing defect passivation and structural stability.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Surface and Grain Boundary Passivation**  \nOrganic cations also accumulate at perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries due to their lower solubility and higher affinity for defect-rich regions. This leads to:  \n- **Surface passivation**: Adsorption of cations on undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or I⁻ sites at surfaces/grain boundaries blocks non-radiative recombination pathways. For instance, bulky cations like GA⁺ sterically hinder moisture-induced degradation and passivate halide vacancies.  \n- **Reduced trap density**: By passivating surface defects, additives lower the density of shallow and deep traps, which are major contributors to Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Structural Modulation for Enhanced Crystallinity**  \nAdditives influence perovskite crystallization kinetics and morphology:  \n- **Slowed nucleation/growth**: Organic cations can delay phase separation and Ostwald ripening, promoting larger, more uniform grains with fewer grain boundaries—key sites for recombination.  \n- **Improved lattice coherence**: Substitutional cations (e.g., FA⁺ in FA/MA hybrid perovskites) reduce lattice strain compared to pure MA-based perovskites, minimizing structural defects that scatter carriers.  \n\n---\n\n### **Impact on Charge Carrier Mobility and Recombination**  \n- **Enhanced mobility**: Reduced defect density and improved crystallinity lower carrier scattering, increasing charge carrier diffusion lengths (e.g., from ~100 nm to >1 µm in FA/MA mixed perovskites).  \n- **Suppressed recombination**: Passivation of bulk and surface traps reduces both radiative (via defect-state quenching) and non-radiative recombination (via trap-mediated processes), increasing open-circuit voltage (\\(V_{\\text{OC}}\\)) and fill factor (\\(FF\\)).  \n- **Stabilized operation**: Additives often improve environmental stability (e.g., moisture resistance), indirectly preserving long-term mobility and recombination characteristics.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nOrganic cation additives function as **dual-purpose defect engineers**, simultaneously suppressing recombination losses and enhancing charge transport by passivating defects, modulating structure, and stabilizing interfaces. These effects are critical for achieving high-efficiency PSCs (>25% certified) and are tailored by optimizing additive type, concentration, and crystallization kinetics.",

    "model_output": "Halide salts, such as lithium iodide (LiI) or cesium iodide (CsI), function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by mitigating defects through multiple interrelated mechanisms, ultimately enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE). The key mechanisms are as follows:\n\n### 1. **Halide Ion Supplementation and Vacancy Passivation**  \nHalide salts provide excess halide ions (e.g., I⁻) during perovskite crystallization. These ions compensate for halide vacancies (e.g., V_I⁻) in the ABX₃ lattice, which are major sources of non-radiative recombination. By filling these vacancies, the halide ions reduce the density of trap states, thereby suppressing charge carrier trapping and improving minority carrier lifetime. This mechanism is particularly critical in mitigating defects arising from stoichiometric imbalance during precursor mixing or solvent annealing.\n\n### 2. **Cation Substitution and Lattice Stabilization**  \nFor additives like CsI, the Cs⁺ cation substitutes into the A-site (e.g., replacing MA⁺ in CH₃NH₃PbI₃), forming mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., CsMA-PbI₃). The larger ionic radius of Cs⁺ (vs. MA⁺) induces strain in the lattice, which stabilizes the black (α) phase over the low-conductivity δ-phase. This phase stabilization reduces interfacial defects and enhances carrier mobility by promoting a more ordered crystal structure with fewer grain boundaries and dislocations.\n\n### 3. **Surface Passivation**  \nExcess halide ions from the additive adsorb onto the perovskite surface, passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites at grain boundaries or surfaces. These undercoordinated sites typically act as electron traps, promoting recombination. Halide passivation neutralizes these sites, reducing surface recombination velocity and improving open-circuit voltage (V_oc) by minimizing non-radiative pathways.\n\n### 4. **Defect Complexation with Undercoordinated Pb²⁺**  \nHalide ions can form complexes with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, which arise from Pb interstitials or vacancies. These complexes (e.g., Pb-I coordination) suppress the formation of deep-level traps that would otherwise localize charge carriers. This mechanism is particularly effective in mitigating Pb interstitial defects, which are detrimental to optoelectronic performance.\n\n### 5. **Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \nHalide salts slow the nucleation and growth kinetics of perovskite crystals, allowing for more ordered, large-grained films with fewer defects.

However, excessive halide segregation degrades mobility by introducing energetic disorder.\n- **Recombination Losses:** Halide passivation of vacancies and uniform composition suppress non-radiative recombination. Phase segregation, however, creates interfacial recombination sites, increasing losses and reducing open-circuit voltage (*Voc*).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Organic Ligands (e.g., oleic acid, oleylamine)**\n#### **Mechanism & Interaction:**\n- **Surface Capping & Grain Growth Control:** Ligands adsorb onto nascent perovskite crystal surfaces, slowing nucleation and promoting lateral grain growth. This results in larger, more uniform grains with fewer grain boundaries, which are major sites for recombination.\n- **Defect Passivation:** Ligands can occupy undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites at surfaces and grain boundaries, passivating trap states that would otherwise trap carriers. Their polar functional groups (e.g., carboxylates) coordinate with Pb²⁺, stabilizing the lattice and reducing ion migration.\n- **Interfacial Engineering:** Ligands may form a passivation layer at the perovskite–hole transport material interface, reducing interfacial defects and energy barriers for charge extraction.\n\n#### **Impact on Film Quality & Performance:**\n- **Charge Carrier Mobility:** Larger grain sizes and reduced grain boundaries lower scattering events, improving carrier mobility. Surface passivation further reduces trap-assisted scattering, enhancing charge collection efficiency.\n- **Recombination Losses:** Fewer defects and grain boundaries minimize non-radiative recombination pathways, boosting *Voc* and fill factor (*FF*). Excessive ligand concentrations, however, may introduce steric hindrance or residual organic residues, increasing recombination at interfaces.\n\n---\n\n### **Synergistic Effects**\nCombined use of halides and ligands can yield additive benefits: halides optimize composition and defect chemistry, while ligands enhance crystallinity and passivate surfaces. For example, Br⁻ substitution with ligand-capped growth produces high-quality, low-defect films with balanced mobility and suppressed recombination, enabling high-efficiency devices. However, imbalances in additive ratios may exacerbate phase segregation or residual defects, highlighting the importance of precise stoichiometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nHalides and organic ligands act synergistically to refine perovskite morphology, reduce defect densities, and passivate recombination sites. Their effects on mobility and recombination are critically dependent on additive type, concentration, and interfacial interactions, underscoring the need for tailored formulations to achieve optimal optoelectronic performance.",

Effects on Crystallization Process**  \nInorganic metal salts (e.g., SnCl₂, PbI₂, Cs₂SnCl₆) modulate the **crystallization kinetics** by altering nucleation and grain growth pathways. Key mechanisms include:  \n- **Nucleation inhibition**: Metal ions from the additive (e.g., Sn²⁺, Pb²⁺) compete with the primary cations (e.g., Pb²⁺ in MAPbI₃) for incorporation into the growing perovskite lattice.

    "model_output": "Iodine-based precursor additives mitigate defects in perovskite solar cells through a combination of stoichiometric compensation, defect site occupation, and modulation of crystallization kinetics. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n### 1. **Stoichiometric Compensation of Vacancies**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., MAPbI₃) often exhibit intrinsic defects such as Pb²⁺ vacancies (V_Pb) and I⁻ vacancies (V_I). These vacancies arise from non-stoichiometric precursor ratios or kinetic limitations during crystallization. Excess iodide ions (I⁻) from additives (e.g., LiI, CsI, or MAI itself) act as a reservoir to compensate for these defects:  \n- **Pb Vacancies**: V_Pb sites create localized positive charge due to missing Pb²⁺ cations. Excess I⁻ can intercalate into the lattice, neutralizing the charge and filling the vacancy via substitutional incorporation (e.g., forming I⁻–I⁻ dimers or occupying interstitial sites).  \n- **I Vacancies**: V_I sites generate localized electron traps. Excess I⁻ can directly fill these vacancies, restoring stoichiometry and eliminating trap states.  \n\n### 2. **Passivation of Grain Boundaries and Surfaces**  \nGrain boundaries and surfaces in polycrystalline perovskites are prone to under-coordinated ions and non-stoichiometric regions, which act as recombination centers. Iodide additives:  \n- **Promote Facetted Growth**: Excess I⁻ slows nucleation kinetics, favoring larger, more uniform grains with fewer defects. This reduces the density of grain boundary traps.  \n- **Surface Termination**: I⁻ can terminate under-coordinated Pb²⁺ ions at surfaces and grain boundaries, passivating dangling bonds and suppressing non-radiative recombination.  \n\n### 3. **Suppression of Halide Segregation and Phase Instability**  \nIn mixed-halide perovskites (e.g., FA/MA-Pb(I/Br)), iodide additives counteract halide phase segregation (e.g., Br-rich domains at surfaces). By stabilizing the iodide-rich phase, they prevent the formation of mid-gap defect states associated with halide vacancies or interstitials.  \n\n### 4. **Electronic Defect Passivation**  \nDefects such as V_Pb and I⁻ interstitials (I_i) introduce mid-gap states that trap charge carriers. Iodide additives:  \n- **Fill Deep-Level Traps**: I⁻ can occupy V_Pb sites, eliminating deep donor/acceptor levels.  \n- **Modify Band Structure**: Excess I⁻ may shift the Fermi level or reduce the density of states at the band edges, enhancing open-circuit voltage (Voc) by suppressing Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.  \n\n### 5. **Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nIodide additives delay perovskite nucleation, enabling prolonged ion diffusion and defect annihilation before crystallization completes. This results in fewer intrinsic defects and smoother films with reduced pinholes.  \n\n### **Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: Enhanced crystallinity (larger grains), reduced defect density, and improved surface passivation.  \n- **Device Performance**:  \n  - **Voc** increases due to fewer mid-gap traps.  \n  - **Fill Factor (FF)** improves as non-radiative recombination at defects is suppressed.  \n  - **Stability** is enhanced by mitigating halide segregation and moisture sensitivity.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nIodine-based additives function via stoichiometric defect compensation, kinetic control of crystallization, and surface/grain boundary passivation.

For device performance, they can affect charge transport pathways, passivate defects, and enhance the stability of the perovskite structure, potentially improving PCE and long-term stability.",
    "model_output": "Metal halide salts such as PbI₂ act as critical additives in perovskite solar cell precursors by modulating crystallization kinetics, passivating defects, and promoting phase stability, thereby enhancing film quality and device performance.  \n\n### **1. Crystallization Kinetics and Morphology Control**  \nPbI₂ slows nucleation by introducing a stoichiometric excess of Pb²⁺ ions in the precursor solution. This excess delays the formation of MAPbI₃ (where MA⁺ = CH₃NH₃⁺) by requiring additional MAI to reach the perovskite stoichiometry (MA⁺:Pb²⁺:I⁻ = 1:1:3). The prolonged nucleation period reduces the density of nucleation sites, favoring **large-grained microstructures** with fewer grain boundaries. Large grains minimize non-radiative recombination at grain boundaries, improving charge carrier mobility and reducing energy loss. Concurrently, PbI₂’s slow dissolution kinetics during spin-coating and annealing promotes **layer-by-layer crystal growth**, reducing pinholes and improving film uniformity.  \n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \nPbI₂ mitigates intrinsic defects in the perovskite lattice, such as Pb vacancies (V_Pb) and iodide vacancies (V_I). Excess Pb²⁺ ions from PbI₂ act as a reservoir to fill V_Pb sites, which are major recombination centers. Additionally, PbI₂ may scavenge residual MAI during crystallization, preventing MA⁺-rich regions that could form iodide vacancies (V_I). By suppressing these defects, PbI₂ reduces trap states, lowering dark current and enhancing open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n\n### **3. Phase Stability and Environmental Resistance**  \nPbI₂ stabilizes the α-phase (black phase) of MAPbI₃ by suppressing the formation of metastable δ-phase (yellow phase) or PbI₂-rich domains. The additive’s lattice structure templating effect guides the perovskite into a more ordered crystal arrangement, reducing structural disorder. This enhances **ion migration resistance** (a key degradation mechanism) and improves stability under thermal and moisture stress. Additionally, PbI₂ may form a passivation layer at the perovskite surface, blocking moisture ingress and mitigating interfacial defects.  \n\n### **Impact on Device Performance**  \n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE):** Enhanced grain size and reduced defects improve Voc, FF, and light absorption, boosting PCE.  \n- **Stability:** Reduced ion migration and defect density slow performance degradation, extending operational lifetime under ambient conditions.  \n\nIn summary, PbI₂ operates through kinetic control of crystallization, defect mitigation via stoichiometric compensation, and phase stabilization, collectively optimizing perovskite films for high-performance, stable photovoltaic devices.",

Their impact on device performance arises from three primary mechanisms:\n\n### 1. **Cation Substitution and Lattice Engineering**  \n   - **Mechanism**: Metal salts introduce additional cations (e.g., Cs⁺, Rb⁺, Sn²⁺) into the perovskite lattice during crystallization. These cations substitute for organic cations (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺) in the A-site or replace Pb²⁺ in the B-site, forming mixed-cation/halide perovskites (e.g., CsMAFA-PbI₃).  \n   - **Interaction with Components**: Cs⁺/Rb⁺ stabilize the perovskite structure by occupying the A-site, increasing lattice strain due to their larger ionic radii compared to MA⁺. This strain suppresses ion migration and phase segregation (e.g., α→δ phase transition in MAPbI₃), enhancing structural stability. Sn²⁺, when incorporated into the B-site, can dope the perovskite, modulating its electronic bandgap and improving carrier mobility.  \n   - **Impact**: Reduced ion mobility and stabilized lattice dynamics mitigate hysteresis and degradation under operational conditions, improving long-term stability. The modified bandgap (e.g., narrower in Cs-rich perovskites) enhances light absorption and charge extraction, boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE).\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation and Charge Carrier Lifetime**  \n   - **Mechanism**: Metal salts scavenge halide vacancies (V_{X}⁻) and interstitial defects (e.g., Pb interstitials) that act as non-radiative recombination centers. For example, Cs⁺ insertion compensates for Pb vacancies, while Sn²⁺ can neutralize iodide vacancies.  \n   - **Interaction with Defects**: CsI reacts with residual PbI₂ in the precursor solution, reducing Pb excess that would otherwise form Pb interstitials. SnCl₂ donates Cl⁻ ions, which passivate iodide vacancies and trap mid-gap states.  \n   - **Impact**: Reduced defect density lowers non-radiative recombination losses, increasing open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). This directly elevates PCE by improving charge carrier lifetime and collection efficiency.\n\n### 3. **Crystallization Kinetics and Morphology Control**  \n   - **Mechanism**: Metal salts slow nucleation and promote oriented grain growth by altering the solution’s supersaturation and surface energy. For instance, CsI delays perovskite nucleation, enabling larger, more uniform grains.  \n   - **Interaction with Components**: The additives act as nucleation inhibitors, favoring 2D-to-3D phase evolution and reducing pinholes. SnCl₂ can also induce facet-selective growth, enhancing crystal perfection.  \n   - **Impact**: Larger grain sizes (micron-scale) reduce grain boundary density, minimizing recombination at these interfaces. A pinhole-free, dense film improves light harvesting and charge transport, enhancing PCE and suppressing shunting effects.\n\n### **Overall Impact on Device Performance**  \n- **Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)**: The combined effects of reduced recombination, enhanced charge transport, and optimized bandgap tuning typically increase PCE by 1–3% absolute, depending on the additive and processing conditions.  \n- **Stability**: Mixed-cation perovskites exhibit improved moisture/heat resistance due to lattice strain and defect passivation.

These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers, degrading photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes and carrier mobility.  \n\n**Interaction**: Ligands coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at defect sites, filling VPb or stabilizing dangling bonds. For example, carboxylate groups (–COO⁻) form bidentate complexes with Pb²⁺, while amine groups (–NH₂) can trap halide vacancies.

Phase Stability and Composition Control**  \n**Mechanism**: Ligands can stabilize the desired perovskite phase (e.g., α-phase) over metastable or non-perovskite phases (e.g., δ-phase or PbI₂). They may also suppress halide segregation in mixed-cation or mixed-halide systems.  \n\n**Interaction**: Ligands adsorb preferentially on specific crystal facets, directing growth toward the thermodynamically favored phase. For instance, long-chain alkylamines stabilize {100} facets, promoting α-phase formation. In mixed-halide systems (e.g., FA/MA/Pb/I/Br), ligands can slow ion exchange kinetics, preventing Br⁻ segregation to the surface.  \n\n**Influence**: Phase-pure films with uniform composition exhibit enhanced stability and suppressed hysteresis. Reduced halide segregation improves bandgap tunability and environmental stability, critical for long-term device performance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Anti-Solvent and Surface Smoothing Effects**  \n**Mechanism**: Some ligands act as poor solvents for the perovskite, inducing a compositional gradient during spin-coating. This drives **spinodal decomposition**, where perovskite-rich and ligand-rich domains separate, promoting dense, pinhole-free films.  \n\n**Interaction**: Ligands partition to the film surface during solvent evaporation, reducing surface roughness and defects. Their hydrophobicity also limits moisture-induced degradation during processing.  \n\n**Influence**: Smooth, pinhole-free films improve charge extraction and reduce interfacial losses, enhancing short-circuit current density (*Jsc*) and device stability.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples and Experimental Validation**  \n- **Oleic acid**: Enhances grain size and passivates Pb vacancies in MAPbI₃.  \n- **Phenylethylammonium (PEA⁺)**: Stabilizes α-phase and suppresses δ-phase formation in formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites.  \n- **Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)**: Directs {100} facet growth, improving carrier mobility.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nOrganic ligands in perovskite precursors act as **crystallization regulators**, **defect scavengers**, and **phase stabilizers**, synergistically improving film morphology, stoichiometry, and defect tolerance.

    "question": "How does lithium iodide (LiI) passivate defects in perovskite materials?",
    "reference_answer": "Lithium iodide (LiI) acts as an additive that can passivate defects in perovskite materials by providing iodide ions to fill vacancies and lithium cations that may interact with defect sites.",
    "model_output": "Lithium iodide (LiI) passivates defects in perovskite materials through a combination of ionic substitution, charge compensation, and structural stabilization, which collectively reduce non-radiative recombination and enhance optoelectronic performance. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Chemistry and Passivation Mechanism**  \nPerovskite materials (e.g., MAPbI₃) inherently contain defects such as **iodide vacancies (VI)**, **lead vacancies (VPb)**, and **interstitial defects**, which act as trap states for charge carriers. These defects create mid-gap energy levels, promoting non-radiative recombination and degrading open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).\n\n#### **a. Lithium Ion Substitution and Charge Compensation**  \n- **Li⁺ substitution in the A-site**: Lithium ions (Li⁺, ionic radius ~0.076 nm) can substitute for organic cations (e.g., MA⁺, ionic radius ~0.45 nm) in the A-site of the perovskite lattice. This substitution fills vacancies in the A-site, reducing the formation of **VPb** defects (since Pb²⁺ vacancies often arise from missing A-site cations).  \n- **Iodide vacancy passivation**: The iodide (I⁻) component of LiI replenishes iodide vacancies (VI), neutralizing the charge imbalance caused by these defects. Each Li⁺ ion can also compensate for VI defects (charge +1 per Li⁺ vs. charge -1 per VI), eliminating mid-gap trap states.  \n\n#### **b. Surface and Grain Boundary Passivation**  \nLiI forms a **surface passivation layer** by adsorbing onto under-coordinated Pb²⁺ sites at the perovskite surface or grain boundaries. This reduces surface recombination by blocking trap states and forming a dipole layer that stabilizes the Fermi level, enhancing Voc.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Influence on Film Quality**  \n- **Improved crystallinity**: LiI acts as a **nucleation agent**, promoting uniform crystal growth with larger grain sizes. Fewer grain boundaries reduce defect density and non-radiative pathways.  \n- **Reduced pinholes and voids**: The addition of LiI during spin-coating or annealing suppresses phase segregation and traps residual precursors, yielding smoother, more compact films.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Device Performance Enhancement**  \n- **Charge carrier lifetime**: By eliminating trap states, LiI increases the minority carrier lifetime (τ) and reduces hysteresis, improving charge extraction efficiency.  \n- **Open-circuit voltage (Voc)**: Surface and bulk defect passivation suppress recombination, enabling Voc values closer to the material’s theoretical limit.  \n- **Stability**: LiI’s stabilizing effect on the perovskite lattice mitigates degradation pathways (e.g., ion migration) under operational conditions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary**  \nLiI passivates defects in perovskites through **Li⁺ substitution in the A-site**, **I⁻ replenishment of VI defects**, and **surface passivation**, thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination. These actions enhance film crystallinity, reduce trap densities, and improve optoelectronic properties, leading to higher efficiency and stability in perovskite solar cells.

This controlled kinetics promotes homogeneous nucleation and reduces defect-rich microstructural features (e.g., pinholes, grain boundaries).  \n- **Solvent Engineering**: Amides act as co-solvents, altering the solvent polarity and volatility. This slows solvent evaporation, enabling larger, more ordered grains with fewer intrinsic defects.  \n\n### 3. **Stabilization of Stoichiometry and Phase Purity**  \nAmides mitigate composition fluctuations during film formation:  \n- **Reduced Halide Segregation**: The amine group stabilizes halide ions, preventing their depletion during annealing, which would otherwise induce halide vacancies or mixed-halide phase segregation.  \n- **Suppression of Non-Stoichiometric Phases**: By coordinating with Pb²⁺ and halides, amides favor the formation of the desired perovskite phase (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) over metastable or defective phases.  \n\n### 4. **Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Morphological Improvement**: Larger grain sizes and fewer defects reduce interfacial recombination and non-radiative losses, enhancing charge carrier lifetimes.  \n- **Reduced Deep-Level Traps**: Passivation of Pb and halide vacancies suppresses mid-gap states, improving open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  \n- **Enhanced Stability**: Amide-induced surface passivation and structural order reduce moisture and oxygen sensitivity, prolonging device operational lifetime.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nAmide additives function as both kinetic modulators and chemical passivants. Their polar functional groups directly bind to defect sites, while their solvent properties optimize crystallization dynamics.

    "reference_answer": "The organic cations passivate defects by forming a layer on the perovskite surface through coordination with metal cations, replace some defective metal cations in the perovskite lattice, fill in vacancies, reduce non - radiative recombination, and ultimately enhance charge carrier mobility and extraction, leading to improved power conversion efficiency.",
    "model_output": "**Key Steps in Defect Passivation and Charge Mobility Enhancement by Organic Cations in FAI-Based Perovskite Additives**\n\n1. **Defect Site Occupancy and Charge Compensation**  \n   Organic cations (e.g., methylammonium (MA⁺), cesium (Cs⁺), or other alkylammonium species) introduced as additives in FAI-based precursors preferentially occupy intrinsic defects in the perovskite lattice, such as iodine vacancies (VI) or lead interstitials (Pb_i). These defects act as electron or hole traps, inducing non-radiative recombination. The organic cations neutralize the charge imbalance caused by these defects (e.g., MA⁺ compensates VI⁻), thereby suppressing trap states in the bandgap. This reduces recombination losses and stabilizes the electronic structure.\n\n2. **Surface and Grain Boundary Passivation**  \n   During crystallization, organic cations adsorb at perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries, forming a passivating layer. These regions are prone to defects due to undercoordinated ions and structural discontinuities. The cations block defect-mediated recombination pathways by passivating dangling bonds and suppressing the formation of mid-gap states. For instance, MA⁺ or formamidinium (FA⁺) additives can form a dense, ordered overlayer at the perovskite/transport layer interface, enhancing interfacial charge extraction.\n\n3. **Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \n   Additives slow nucleation and promote oriented crystal growth by acting as surfactants. This reduces the density of grain boundaries and defects associated with rapid, uncontrolled nucleation. Organic cations partition into the precursor solution, delaying phase separation between PbI₂ and FAI. Prolonged nucleation intervals allow larger, more uniform grains to form, minimizing trap-rich grain boundaries and improving charge transport pathways.\n\n4. **Lattice Strain Relief and Structural Order**  \n   Partial substitution of FA⁺ with larger organic cations (e.g., Cs⁺) in the perovskite lattice induces compressive strain, which can suppress the formation of metastable phases (e.g., δ-phase) and stabilize the desired black-phase perovskite. This substitution also refines the crystal structure, reducing structural disorder and associated electronic disorder (e.g., bandgap fluctuations), thereby enhancing carrier mobility.\n\n**Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Defect Passivation**: Reduced trap densities lower non-radiative recombination, increasing minority carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (Voc).  \n- **Grain Boundary Reduction**: Larger grain sizes and fewer defects improve charge carrier diffusion lengths and reduce interfacial recombination, boosting fill factor (FF).  \n- **Enhanced Mobility**: A more ordered lattice and fewer scattering centers (e.g., defects, grain boundaries) increase charge carrier mobility, particularly in high-quality bulk regions.  \n- **Stability**: Passivation of surface and bulk defects mitigates degradation pathways (e.g., moisture-induced decomposition), improving operational stability.  \n\nThese mechanisms collectively optimize the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films, enabling higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in solar cells.",

Common examples include:  \n- **Cesium (Cs⁺)**: Replaces MA⁺/FA⁺ in the A-site (e.g., CsMAFA perovskites).  \n- **Sn²⁺/Ge⁴⁺**: Substitute Pb²⁺ in the B-site (e.g., Sn-doped perovskites).  \n- **Metal oxides**: Nanoparticles of TiO₂, ZnO (though these are often part of the electron/hole transport layers).  \n- **Iodide precursors**: SnI₂, PbI₂ (to modulate stoichiometry).  \n\n**Defect Passivation Mechanism**:  \nCs⁺ stabilizes the **black-phase perovskite** by occupying A-sites, reducing phase instability and iodide vacancies. Sn²⁺/Ge⁴⁺ in the B-site can compensate for Pb vacancies, though excessive substitution introduces new defects. Metal oxides (e.g., TiO₂ nanoparticles) act as **deep-trap passivators** by scavenging surface defects via surface passivation or charge extraction.  \n\n**Influence on Crystallization**:  \nCs⁺ slows crystallization by **stabilizing the precursor solution**, enabling homogeneous nucleation and reducing pinholes. B-site dopants (e.g., Sn²⁺) can induce **polycrystalline domain alignment** or phase segregation, depending on concentration.

    "model_output": "Formamidinium cations (FA⁺) introduced via formamidinium iodide (FAI) in perovskite solar cells play multifaceted roles that enhance optoelectronic performance and stability through distinct chemical and physical mechanisms:\n\n### 1. **Structural Stabilization of the Perovskite Phase**  \n   - **Mechanism**: FA⁺ (ionic radius ~0.48 Å) has a smaller radius than methylammonium (MA⁺, ~0.52 Å) but larger than cesium (Cs⁺, ~0.46 Å). This size difference modulates the octahedral Pb-I framework, favoring the thermodynamically stable **black α-phase** over the unstable δ-phase. The FA⁺ cation’s asymmetric geometry (compared to the symmetric Cs⁺) induces a compressive strain on the Pb-I lattice, stabilizing the perovskite structure at elevated temperatures.  \n   - **Interaction**: FA⁺ occupies the A-site in the ABX₃ structure, displacing MA⁺ or Cs⁺ in mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅Pb(I₀.₈₅Br₀.₁₅)₃). This reduces phase segregation and maintains stoichiometry under operational conditions.  \n   - **Outcome**: Enhanced phase stability suppresses degradation pathways (e.g., iodide vacancy formation) and improves long-term device performance under thermal or moisture stress.\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation and Charge Carrier Dynamics**  \n   - **Mechanism**: FA⁺ mitigates intrinsic defects such as Pb vacancies (V_Pb²⁺) and iodide interstitials (I_i⁻), which act as non-radiative recombination centers. The cation’s polar nature (due to its NH₃CH-NH₃⁺ structure) facilitates hydrogen bonding with halide ions, stabilizing the lattice and reducing defect formation.  \n   - **Interaction**: FA⁺ preferentially fills A-site vacancies, compensating for charge imbalances. Additionally, its smaller size reduces lattice strain, lowering the formation energy of defects.  \n   - **Outcome**: Reduced defect density enhances open-circuit voltage (Voc) by minimizing non-radiative recombination and improves charge carrier lifetime, boosting fill factor (FF).\n\n### 3. **Crystallization Kinetics and Film Morphology**  \n   - **Mechanism**: FAI in precursor solutions promotes **slow nucleation and controlled growth** during spin-coating or vapor-assisted deposition. The cation’s polarity enhances solubility in polar solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide), enabling homogeneous precursor mixing.  \n   - **Interaction**: FA⁺ interacts with Pb²⁺ ions in the precursor solution, delaying nucleation and favoring large-grained, pinhole-free films. The cation’s hydrogen-bonding network also suppresses premature crystallization.  \n   - **Outcome**: Improved crystallinity and reduced grain boundaries lower interfacial recombination, enhancing charge transport and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).\n\n### 4. **Bandgap Tuning and Light Absorption**  \n   - **Mechanism**: FA⁺ modifies the electronic band structure by compressing the Pb-I octahedra, narrowing the bandgap compared to MA-based perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅PbI₃ has a bandgap of ~1.5 eV vs. ~1.6 eV for MAPbI₃). This adjustment optimizes absorption in the visible spectrum while balancing voltage losses.  \n   - **Interaction**: The cation’s electronic configuration (donating electrons to the conduction band) shifts the valence band maximum, enabling better alignment with electron/hole transport layers.  \n   - **Outcome**: Enhanced light harvesting and reduced voltage deficit improve short-circuit current (Jsc) and Voc.\n\n### 5. **Suppression of Ion Migration and Environmental Stability**  \n   - **Mechanism**: FA⁺’s rigid, hydrogen-bonded structure reduces ionic mobility compared to MA⁺, inhibiting ion migration under operational bias. The cation’s smaller size also strengthens Pb-I bonding, resisting structural degradation under humidity or thermal stress.  \n   - **Interaction**: FA⁺ stabilizes the perovskite surface by passivating dangling bonds, reducing hydrolysis reactions.  \n   - **Outcome**: Mitigated hysteresis and improved operational stability under prolonged illumination or environmental exposure.\n\n### Conclusion  \nFA⁺ cations enhance perovskite solar cell performance through synergistic effects on structural stability, defect passivation, crystallization dynamics, optoelectronic properties, and environmental resilience. These roles are rooted in FA⁺’s unique ionic size, electronic structure, and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which collectively optimize film quality and device functionality.",

    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts such as formamidinium (FA⁺) and methylammonium (MA⁺) passivate defects in perovskite solar cells through a combination of **charge compensation**, **structural stabilization**, and **hydrogen-bonding interactions**, which collectively reduce non-radiative recombination and improve optoelectronic performance.  \n\n### **1. Defect Chemistry in Perovskites**  \nPerovskite materials (e.g., CH₃NH₃PbI₃ or (HC(NH₂)₂)PbI₃) are prone to intrinsic defects such as **iodine vacancies (VI⁻)** and **lead interstitials (Pi²⁺)**. These defects act as trap states, creating localized energy levels within the bandgap. Electrons and holes recombine non-radiatively at these traps, reducing charge-carrier lifetimes and device efficiency.  \n\n### **2. Mechanism of Defect Passivation**  \n#### **a. Charge Compensation**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺ cations occupy the A-site in the perovskite lattice, substituting for missing iodide ions in **iodine vacancies**. Each VI⁻ defect introduces a +1 charge imbalance, which FA/MA cations neutralize by inserting into the vacancy. This eliminates the charge-localized trap states that would otherwise act as recombination centers.  \n\n#### **b. Coordination with Undercoordinated Pb²⁺ Ions**  \nAt grain boundaries or surfaces, Pb²⁺ ions may become undercoordinated due to missing halide ligands. FA⁺ and MA⁺ cations, with their lone-pair electrons, act as **Lewis bases**, forming coordination bonds with these undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites. This stabilizes the local structure, preventing the formation of dangling bonds that contribute to trap states.  \n\n#### **c. Hydrogen-Bonding Stabilization**  \nThe organic ammonium groups (e.g., –NH₃⁺ in MA⁺ or –NH₂ in FA⁺) form **hydrogen bonds** with adjacent halide ions (e.g., I⁻) at defect sites or grain boundaries. These bonds reduce structural disorder and suppress halide ion migration, which is a precursor to defect formation.  \n\n### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Reduced Defect Density**: Passivation of VI⁻ and Pb²⁺ traps lowers the density of mid-gap states, increasing charge-carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths.  \n- **Enhanced Crystallinity**: FA/MA additives promote **oriented crystallization**, yielding larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries—regions where defects and recombination are concentrated.  \n- **Improved Bandgap Engineering**: Mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA/MA) exhibit tunable bandgaps and reduced sensitivity to lattice strain, further suppressing defect formation.  \n\n### **4. Device Performance Outcomes**  \n- **Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc)**: Reduced trap-mediated recombination increases Voc by minimizing electron-hole recombination losses.  \n- **Fill Factor (FF)**: Improved charge transport in defect-passivated films enhances FF by reducing series resistance and non-radiative losses.  \n- **Stability**: Hydrogen-bonding and structural stabilization slow ion migration and phase segregation, prolonging device lifetime.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺ function as **dual-mode passivators**: they neutralize charge imbalances at iodine vacancies, stabilize undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites via coordination, and suppress structural disorder through hydrogen bonding.

    "model_output": "The iodide ions (I⁻) from ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) play critical roles in perovskite solar cells through defect passivation, stoichiometry regulation, and crystallization control, directly influencing film quality and device performance. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation via Iodide Incorporation**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., FA/MA/Pb/I-based) inherently contain iodide vacancies (VI), which act as non-radiative recombination centers and mid-gap electronic states. Iodide ions from NH₄I and FAI act as **mobile dopants** during film formation, diffusing into the perovskite lattice to fill these vacancies. This reduces defect density, suppressing carrier recombination and improving open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The excess iodide also passivates interfacial defects at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, enhancing charge extraction efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Stoichiometry Compensation and Crystallization Control**  \nDuring spin-coating or annealing, iodide can evaporate due to its low volatility compared to organic cations (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺). NH₄I and FAI act as **iodide reservoirs**, providing additional I⁻ to compensate for stoichiometric deficiencies. This ensures the formation of the desired ABX₃ perovskite phase (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅Pb(I₀.₈₅Br₀.₁₅)₃) and prevents the formation of PbI₂-rich domains, which degrade optoelectronic properties.  \n\nThe excess iodide also modulates crystallization kinetics. I⁻ ions act as **nucleation inhibitors**, slowing grain growth and promoting the formation of larger, more uniform grains. This reduces the density of grain boundaries, which are sites for trap states and recombination, thereby improving charge-carrier diffusion lengths and overall film homogeneity.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Surface Passivation and Environmental Stability**  \nAt the perovskite surface, iodide ions from NH₄I and FAI form a **protective surface layer** by reacting with residual Pb²⁺ ions. This layer blocks moisture and oxygen ingress, mitigating oxidative degradation pathways (e.g., Pb²⁺ → Pb⁰) and enhancing device stability under operational conditions. Additionally, the surface iodide layer suppresses interfacial energy losses by passivating surface defects such as undercoordinated Pb sites.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Suppression of Hysteresis**  \nIodide-rich regions near the perovskite surface or grain boundaries can reduce ferroelectric domain polarization, a key contributor to hysteresis in perovskite devices. By stabilizing the local structure and reducing trap densities, iodide additives minimize the voltage-dependent polarization effects, improving reproducibility and performance consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Effects on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: Enhanced grain size, reduced defect density, and uniform stoichiometry lead to smoother, pinhole-free films with improved crystallinity.  \n- **Device Performance**:  \n  - **VOC** increases due to reduced recombination losses.  \n  - **FF** improves from better charge extraction and suppressed interfacial recombination.  \n  - **Stability** is enhanced via environmental passivation and defect mitigation.  \n\nThe iodide ions from NH₄I and FAI thus act as multifunctional agents, synergistically addressing stoichiometric, structural, and interfacial challenges in perovskite solar cells.

Crystallization Mechanism and Additive Interactions**\n#### **MAI (Methylammonium Iodide)**\n- **Mechanism**: MAI serves as a primary A-site cation source (MA⁺) in perovskite precursors (e.g., MAPbI₃). Excess MAI in precursor solutions promotes **homogeneous nucleation** by providing a surplus of MA⁺ ions, which accelerates the formation of perovskite nuclei. However, high MAI concentrations can also induce **competitive crystallization pathways**, leading to mixed-phase perovskites (e.g., α/δ phases) if not properly annealed.\n- **Defect Interaction**: MA⁺ cations can occupy interstitial sites or substitute for Pb²⁺ in the lattice, introducing strain. Excess MAI may also lead to **iodide vacancy defects (V_I)** due to stoichiometric imbalance, which act as non-radiative recombination centers.\n- **Film Quality**: Moderate MAI concentrations enhance **grain growth** by delaying nucleation, yielding larger grains and reduced trap densities. Excess MAI, however, degrades crystallinity by promoting phase segregation.\n\n#### **FAI (Formamidinium Iodide)**\n- **Mechanism**: FAI introduces FA⁺ cations, which have a smaller ionic radius than MA⁺, enabling tighter lattice packing. FAI slows **crystallization kinetics** due to its lower solubility in common solvents (e.g., DMF), promoting **layer-by-layer growth** and minimizing defects. FAI also stabilizes the **δ-phase perovskite**, which exhibits superior thermal and moisture stability compared to the α-phase.\n- **Defect Interaction**: FA⁺ cations reduce **Pb-I antisite defects** (a major non-stoichiometric defect) by optimizing lattice strain. FAI’s incorporation suppresses iodide vacancy formation through improved stoichiometry.\n- **Film Quality**: FAI-rich perovskites exhibit **enhanced grain orientation** (e.g., (110) texture) and reduced surface roughness, improving charge-carrier mobility and open-circuit voltage (Voc).\n\n#### **CsI (Cesium Iodide)**\n- **Mechanism**: Cs⁺, a larger alkali cation, occupies the A-site in mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., CsMAFA-PbI₃). CsI’s low solubility in precursor solvents induces **slow crystallization**, allowing extended defect annealing and minimizing grain boundaries. Cs⁺ also stabilizes the **black-phase perovskite** by reducing lattice strain and suppressing phase transitions.\n- **Defect Interaction**: Cs⁺ mitigates **Pb-I antisite defects** and **MA⁺ interstitial defects** through lattice strain relaxation.

    "model_output": "**Mechanism of Defect Passivation by Precursor Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells**  \n\n**Underlying Chemical/Physical Mechanism:**  \nPrecursor additives, such as organic cations (e.g., phenyl ethyl ammonium, PEAI; formamidinium, FAI) or small molecules (e.g., 5-hydroxyindole, HIL), form stable complexes with defect sites in perovskite films through **coordination chemistry** and **electrostatic interactions**. During perovskite crystallization, defects such as Pb²⁺ vacancies, halide (e.g., I⁻) vacancies, or interstitial species arise due to stoichiometric imbalance or kinetic trapping during phase transformation. These defects create localized electronic states within the bandgap, acting as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers.  \n\nAdditives mitigate this by **binding to undercoordinated ions** at defect sites. For instance, Pb vacancies expose unsaturated Pb²⁺ ions, which can coordinate with the lone-pair electrons of additive ligands (e.g., amine or carboxylate groups). Similarly, halide vacancies may be stabilized by additives with halogen-like substituents (e.g., –I or –Br moieties) that mimic the missing anions. This coordination reduces the energy of defect states, shifting them away from the bandgap and suppressing non-radiative recombination.  \n\n**Interaction with Defects and Components:**  \n1. **Coordination with Pb²⁺ Defects:** Additives such as PEAI possess a long alkyl chain and a positively charged ammonium group. The ammonium group coordinates with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at vacancies, forming a stable complex. This blocks the defect from trapping electrons and reduces trap-assisted recombination.  \n2. **Halide Vacancy Passivation:** Additives like HIL contain electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl or amine) that can donate electrons to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ adjacent to halide vacancies, stabilizing the local structure and eliminating mid-gap states.  \n3. **Suppression of Phase Segregation:** Some additives (e.g., FAI) substitute for MA⁺ in the perovskite lattice, promoting a more uniform composition and reducing phase segregation (e.g., between α- and δ-phase MAPbI₃), which is a source of defects.  \n\n**Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance:**  \n- **Improved Crystallinity:** Additives often slow crystallization kinetics, allowing for more ordered nucleation and grain growth.

Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n### **1. Defect Interaction and Charge Compensation**  \nPerovskite materials (e.g., ABX₃) commonly exhibit defects such as metal cation vacancies (e.g., Pb²⁺ vacancies) or interstitials, which create localized electronic states that act as non-radiative recombination centers. Halides mitigate these defects via:  \n- **Vacancy Passivation**: Halide anions can coordinate with under-coordinated metal cations adjacent to a vacancy, forming a stable coordination environment. For example, a Pb vacancy (charge +2) disrupts the local lattice symmetry and creates a charge imbalance. Halide ions can adsorb to the defect site, neutralizing the charge and restoring structural stability. This reduces the formation energy of the vacancy and suppresses trap states.  \n- **Interstitial Passivation**: Excess metal cations (e.g., interstitial Pb²⁺) can act as electron traps. Halide ions may form a passivating shell around such interstitials, encapsulating them and preventing their interaction with charge carriers.  \n\n### **2. Structural Stabilization and Coordination Environment**  \nHalides directly influence the coordination geometry of metal cations:  \n- In pristine perovskite lattices, each Pb²⁺ is octahedrally coordinated with six halides. Defects disrupt this geometry, inducing strain and electronic disorder. Halide additives or excess halide species in the precursor solution can reorganize during crystallization, promoting defect-free growth by favoring the formation of ordered coordination environments.  \n- Halide-rich regions (e.g., in mixed-halide perovskites) can segregate to defect sites, forming halide-rich domains that suppress ion migration and stabilize the lattice against phase segregation or degradation.  \n\n### **3. Electronic Band Structure Modulation**  \nHalide passivation indirectly improves optoelectronic properties by:  \n- **Reducing Trap-Density**: By neutralizing defect-induced trap states, halides minimize non-radiative recombination pathways, enhancing charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length.  \n- **Bandgap Tuning**: Halide substitution (e.g., Br⁻ for I⁻) can locally adjust the bandgap, aligning it with the defect-free regions and reducing energetic disorder. This improves open-circuit voltage (\\(V_{\\text{oc}}\\)) and fill factor (FF) in devices.  \n\n### **4. Dynamic Defect Healing**  \nIn operational devices, halide ions exhibit mobility under illumination or thermal gradients. This allows them to migrate to newly formed defects (e.g., those induced by ionizing radiation or moisture), dynamically passivating defects over time and prolonging device stability.  \n\n### **Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: Halide passivation reduces defect densities, improving crystallinity and phase purity. This is observed as smoother, pinhole-free films with reduced trap-state densities.  \n- **Device Performance**: The combined effects of reduced recombination, enhanced carrier mobility, and stabilized band structure lead to higher \\(V_{\\text{oc}}\\), FF, and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). Stability is also improved due to suppressed ion migration and defect-driven degradation pathways.  \n\nIn summary, halides act as both structural stabilizers and electronic modifiers, interacting directly with metal cations at defect sites to restore lattice order and suppress detrimental electronic effects, thereby optimizing perovskite optoelectronic performance.",

Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺, when added to precursor solutions (e.g., in lead halide-based systems), act as **growth modifiers** by delaying nucleation and slowing crystal growth. This occurs through:  \n- **Surface adsorption**: These organic cations preferentially adsorb onto the {100} and {110} crystal facets of nascent perovskite grains, forming a steric barrier that suppresses rapid, non-uniform nucleation. This promotes **slower, directional growth**, resulting in larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries.  \n- **Solution viscosity and solubility control**: Additives can alter the precursor solution’s viscosity and solute solubility, extending the nucleation delay and enabling better film coverage during spin-coating or vapor-assisted processes.  \n\n### **2. Defect Passivation**  \nBoth cations mitigate intrinsic defects in the perovskite lattice:  \n- **A-site vacancy compensation**: FA⁺/MA⁺ can substitute into vacant A-sites (e.g., in PbI₆⁴⁻ octahedra), compensating for Pb vacancies (a major source of non-radiative recombination). This reduces mid-gap trap states and improves charge carrier lifetimes.  \n- **Surface passivation**: Excess FA⁺/MA⁺ ions adsorb at the perovskite surface, passivating halide vacancies (e.g., I⁻ defects) and suppressing interfacial defects that otherwise trap electrons or holes.  \n\n### **3. Phase Stability Enhancement**  \nFA⁺ stabilizes the **black α-phase** of perovskites (e.g., in FA/MA/Pb/I systems) by reducing lattice strain compared to pure MA-based perovskites. This minimizes phase segregation and hysteresis, improving thermal and environmental stability. The mixed cation composition also suppresses iodide vacancy formation, which is thermodynamically favored in MA-rich regions.  \n\n### **4. Influence on Film and Device Performance**  \n- **Film quality**: The combined effects of controlled crystallization and defect passivation yield dense, pinhole-free films with **enhanced crystallinity** (evident in XRD peak sharpness) and **reduced trap density** (observed via transient absorption or DLTS measurements).  \n- **Device performance**: Larger grains reduce recombination losses at grain boundaries, improving **open-circuit voltage (Voc)** and **fill factor (FF)**. Defect passivation enhances **charge carrier mobility** and **lifetime**, boosting overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). FA/MA mixtures also suppress hysteresis, yielding more stable and reproducible device behavior.  \n\n### **Summary**  \nFA⁺ and MA⁺ additives synergistically regulate perovskite crystallization by delaying nucleation, passivating defects, and stabilizing phases. These actions optimize film morphology and electronic quality, directly translating to improved optoelectronic performance in solar cells. Their precise stoichiometry in precursor solutions is critical to balancing these effects for optimal device outcomes.",

Mechanism of Action**  \nAmines (e.g., methylamine, butylamine, or formamidine derivatives) act through **coordination chemistry** and **surface passivation**:  \n- **Solubility Enhancement**: Amines form **complexes with lead halide (PbX₂) precursors** (e.g., PbI₂), increasing their solubility in polar solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide, DMSO). The amine’s lone-pair electrons coordinate with Pb²⁺ ions, stabilizing the PbX₂ lattice and delaying precipitation. This extends the precursor solution’s shelf life and enables homogeneous mixing of organic and inorganic components.  \n- **Reactivity Control**: Amines **modulate nucleation kinetics** by passivating Pb²⁺ ions, slowing premature nucleation. This delays perovskite phase formation, allowing precursors to reach a higher supersaturation state. The extended nucleation lag phase promotes **large-grained crystallization** and reduces defect density.  \n- **Defect Passivation**: During crystallization, amines can **incorporate into the perovskite lattice** (e.g., substituting MA⁺/FA⁺ cations) or **adsorb at grain boundaries/surface sites**, passivating halide vacancies (V_X⁻) and interstitial Pb⁰ defects. This suppresses non-radiative recombination pathways.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Interaction with Precursors and Defects**  \n- **Coordination with PbX₂**: Amines bind to Pb²⁺ via **dative bonds**, stabilizing the lead halide precursor in solution. For example, methylamine (CH₃NH₂) forms [Pb(CH₃NH₃)X₃]⁻ complexes, enhancing PbX₂ solubility.  \n- **Defect Passivation**: At the perovskite surface or grain boundaries, amines **neutralize charge traps** by donating electrons to halide vacancies (V_X⁻) or coordinating with undercoordinated Pb sites. This reduces mid-gap states that trap charge carriers.  \n- **Grain Boundary Engineering**: Amines may **adsorb at interfaces**, lowering surface energy and promoting **vertical crystal growth** over lateral growth. This minimizes grain boundary density and associated recombination losses.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Solubility**: Enhanced PbX₂ solubility ensures **homogeneous precursor films** post-spin-coating, reducing phase segregation and non-perovskite byproducts (e.g., PbI₂).  \n- **Crystallinity**: Slowed nucleation and extended growth kinetics lead to **large, pinhole-free grains** with fewer defects, improving **charge carrier mobility** (μ) and **lifetime (τ)**.  \n- **Defect Reduction**: Passivation of V_X⁻ and Pb⁰ defects elevates open-circuit voltage (Voc) by suppressing recombination.  \n- **Stability**: Amines can **inhibit moisture/humidity-induced degradation** by forming a protective layer at the perovskite surface.  \n\n---\n\n### **Outcome**  \nThe combined effects of amine additives result in **high-quality perovskite films** with:  \n- **Enhanced photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield** due to reduced non-radiative recombination.  \n- **Improved optoelectronic properties** (e.g., higher Voc, fill factor (FF)).  \n- **Stable performance** under operational stress (e.g., light, heat).  \n\nExamples include the use of **n-butylamine** to control crystallization kinetics in FA/MA mixed perovskites, or **guanidinium** as a dual-purpose additive for solubility and defect passivation.

    "reference_answer": "Iodide-based precursor additives influence crystallization kinetics by providing iodide ions for lattice formation, passivate defects through interaction with vacancies and interstitial atoms reducing non-radiative recombination, and maintain structure stoichiometry for stability, with underlying mechanisms involving ionic interactions between iodide ions and metal cations and bond formation during crystallization.",
    "model_output": "### Key Functions and Mechanisms of Iodide-Based Precursor Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells\n\n#### 1. **Control of Nucleation and Crystallization Kinetics**  \n   **Mechanism**: Iodide additives (e.g., excess MAI or FAI in the precursor solution) act as a \"nucleation suppressor\" by increasing the local concentration of iodide ions. This competes with the formation of the perovskite phase (e.g., MAPbI₃), delaying nucleation until the precursor solution reaches optimal conditions (e.g., during annealing). The suppressed nucleation allows for homogeneous precursor mixing and slower crystal growth, promoting **large-grained microstructures** with fewer grain boundaries. Reduced grain boundaries minimize defect densities (e.g., interfacial traps) and improve charge transport pathways.  \n\n#### 2. **Defect Passivation**  \n   **Mechanism**: Perovskite films inherently contain defects such as **iodine vacancies (VI)** and **lead interstitials (Pb_i)**, which act as non-radiative recombination centers. Excess iodide ions from additives can diffuse into the film during annealing, filling VI defects via a **stoichiometric compensation mechanism**. This reduces mid-gap trap states, enhancing **charge carrier lifetime** and **open-circuit voltage (Voc)**. Additionally, surface iodide-rich regions form via Ostwald ripening, passivating surface defects and suppressing interfacial charge recombination.  \n\n#### 3. **Phase Stability and Composition Control**  \n   **Mechanism**: Iodide additives stabilize the **black α-phase** of hybrid perovskites (e.g., MAPbI₃) by maintaining a Pb-to-I stoichiometric ratio close to 1:3. Excess iodide counteracts Pb-rich regions that would otherwise drive phase segregation or degradation (e.g., formation of δ-phase or PbI₂). This stabilizes the optoelectronically optimal α-phase under operational conditions (e.g., thermal or moisture stress), improving long-term device stability.  \n\n#### 4. **Film Morphology and Surface Quality**  \n   **Mechanism**: Iodide additives enhance **film pinhole-free coverage** by modulating the precursor viscosity and crystallization front dynamics. Excess iodide ions reduce the supersaturation gradient during spin-coating, enabling smoother nucleation and growth. The resulting dense, smooth films minimize surface roughness and non-conductive domains, improving **light absorption** and **charge extraction efficiency** at the transport layer interfaces.  \n\n#### 5. **Suppression of Non-Stoichiometric Defects**  \n   **Mechanism**: During annealing, iodide additives provide a reservoir of I⁻ ions to compensate for Pb²⁺ excesses arising from incomplete reaction of PbI₂ precursors. This prevents the formation of Pb-rich defects (e.g., Pb interstitials) that induce localized bandgap perturbations and trap states. The stoichiometric balance ensures a uniform electronic structure, critical for high photovoltaic performance.  \n\n### Summary of Effects on Device Performance  \nThese mechanisms collectively enhance **crystallinity**, **charge carrier mobility**, **recombination resistance**, and **operational stability**, directly translating to improved **power conversion efficiency (PCE)** and **device lifetime**. The iodide additive’s role is thus multifaceted, addressing both kinetic and thermodynamic challenges in perovskite film formation and defect mitigation.",

These defects act as non-radiative recombination centers, reducing charge carrier lifetimes and open-circuit voltage (Voc).  \n\n- **Vacancy Filling**: Halide ions from the additive substitute into iodine vacancies, directly filling these defect sites. For example, Cl⁻, being smaller than I⁻, compresses the local lattice, stabilizing the structure and reducing trap states. This substitution lowers the density of deep-level traps, improving charge carrier mobility and reducing recombination losses.  \n- **Surface Passivation**: Halide additives often form a halide-rich surface layer (e.g., Br-rich surfaces in mixed-halide perovskites). This layer passivates surface defects by blocking dangling bonds and suppressing interfacial charge recombination. The smaller ionic radius of Br⁻ or Cl⁻ compared to I⁻ also reduces surface roughness, minimizing grain boundary defects.  \n\n### 2. **Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \nHalide additives influence the crystallization dynamics during film formation, promoting large-grained, pinhole-free perovskite films:  \n\n- **Nucleation and Growth Control**: Halide ions slow the nucleation rate by increasing solution viscosity or stabilizing intermediate phases (e.g., lead iodide precursors), allowing more time for oriented crystal growth. This reduces the density of grain boundaries, which are major sites for defect formation and non-radiative recombination.  \n- **Lattice Strain and Phase Stability**: Incorporation of halide additives (e.g., Cl⁻) into the perovskite lattice introduces compositional strain. This strain can suppress ion migration (e.g., of MA⁺ or FA⁺) and stabilize the perovskite phase against decomposition, particularly under operational conditions.  \n\n### **Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: Halide additives yield smoother, more uniform films with larger crystalline domains (reducing grain boundary density) and fewer intrinsic defects.

The formamidinium cation can form stable complexes with dangling bonds and vacancies in the perovskite lattice, passivating defects. It also interacts with halide anions in the perovskite structure, influencing the crystallization process to promote well - ordered grain formation and reduce defect concentration, enhancing device performance. ",
    "model_output": "**Chemical Components of Formamidinium Bromide (FABr):**  \nFormamidinium bromide (FABr) consists of the organic cation **formamidinium (FA⁺, CH(NH₂)₂⁺)** and the inorganic bromide anion (**Br⁻**). FA⁺ is a larger, asymmetric cation compared to other common perovskite cations (e.g., methylammonium, MA⁺), while Br⁻ is a halide anion with a smaller ionic radius than iodide (I⁻).\n\n---\n\n**Defect Passivation Mechanism:**  \n1. **Cationic Passivation (FA⁺):**  \n   - FA⁺ occupies interstitial sites in the perovskite lattice, particularly substituting for undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries or defects such as **iodine vacancies (V_I)**. These vacancies are major non-radiative recombination centers in mixed-halide perovskites.  \n   - The bulky, asymmetric FA⁺ sterically blocks defect sites, reducing trap states. Additionally, its amine groups can form **hydrogen bonds** or coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or halide ions, stabilizing the lattice and suppressing defect formation.  \n\n2. **Anionic Passivation (Br⁻):**  \n   - Br⁻ substitutes for iodide (I⁻) in the ABX₃ lattice, forming mixed-halide compositions (e.g., FA₀.₈₅MA₀.₁₅Pb(I₀.₈₅Br₀.₁₅)₃). Br⁻ has a lower tendency to form halide vacancies (V_X) due to its higher electronegativity and stronger Pb–Br bonding compared to Pb–I. This reduces halide vacancy-related defects.  \n   - Br⁻ also suppresses **Pb–I antisite defects** (where Pb²⁺ occupies X⁻ sites) by stabilizing the halide sublattice through stronger electrostatic interactions.  \n\n---\n\n**Influence on Crystallization:**  \n1. **Lattice Stabilization:**  \n   - FA⁺’s larger size (vs. MA⁺) increases lattice strain, favoring the formation of the **black (α-phase) perovskite** over metastable phases, enhancing phase stability.  \n   - Br⁻ incorporation reduces the lattice parameter along the **c-axis**, counteracting the expansion caused by FA⁺ and promoting a more ordered crystal structure.  \n\n2. **Crystallization Kinetics:**  \n   - FA⁺ slows nucleation and growth rates due to its steric bulk, allowing extended crystallization times and larger grain formation. This reduces grain boundary density, a common site for defects.  \n   - FABr acts as a **co-crystallization agent**, forming precursor complexes (e.g., FA⁺–PbI₂) that delay decomposition and enable uniform film growth.  \n\n3. **Surface Passivation:**  \n   - During annealing, residual FA⁺/Br⁻ at the perovskite surface forms a passivating layer, reducing surface trap states and improving **open-circuit voltage (Voc)** by suppressing interfacial recombination.  \n\n---\n\n**Resulting Film Quality and Device Performance:**  \n- **Enhanced Crystallinity:** Larger, fewer grain boundaries reduce non-radiative recombination, improving **charge carrier lifetime** and **fill factor (FF)**.  \n- **Reduced Defect Density:** Passivation of V_I, V_X, and antisite defects elevates **photoluminescence (PL) intensity** and **Voc**.  \n- **Stability:** The mixed-cation/halide composition and lattice strain from FA/Br delay ion migration and hysteresis, improving operational stability.  \n\nIn summary, FABr’s dual cationic/anionic components synergistically suppress defects, modulate crystallization dynamics, and stabilize the perovskite lattice, directly translating to higher efficiency and stability in photovoltaic devices.",

Below is a structured explanation of the mechanisms and their consequences:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Mechanism of Crystal Growth Direction Control**  \nMetal ions (e.g., Sn²⁺, Bi³⁺, Cu⁺) introduced as additives interact with perovskite precursor species (e.g., PbI₂ or MAI) during film formation. These ions:  \n- **Form complexes with halide precursors**, delaying nucleation and slowing crystallization kinetics. This extended nucleation period reduces the density of nucleation sites, favoring **large-grained, oriented crystal growth**.  \n- **Adsorb selectively onto high-energy crystal facets** (e.g., {100} or {110} planes) of nascent perovskite nuclei. By passivating these facets, additives suppress their growth rates, promoting **preferential growth along low-energy directions** (e.g., the (001) plane). This anisotropic growth yields **plate-like, vertically oriented grains** aligned perpendicular to the substrate.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Interaction with Defects and Structural Components**  \n- **Defect Passivation**: Metal ions can occupy interstitial sites or substitute for Pb²⁺ in the perovskite lattice, passivating halide vacancies (e.g., V_I⁻) or Pb interstitials. For example, Sn²⁺ substitution reduces iodide vacancy defects, which are major recombination centers.  \n- **Intermediate Complex Formation**: Additives like Sn(II) form metastable Sn–I–MA complexes during solution processing, which gradually decompose to release PbI₂. This **kinetic stabilization** prevents premature crystallization, enabling homogeneous nucleation and minimizing pinholes or phase segregation.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Charge Transport**  \n- **Morphology**: Additives promote **large-grained, smooth films** with reduced grain boundaries and surface roughness. Fewer grain boundaries reduce **non-radiative recombination** and improve charge carrier lifetimes.  \n- **Orientation**: (001)-dominant orientation enhances **anisotropic charge transport**, as the perovskite’s in-plane carrier mobility (along the (001) plane) is typically higher than out-of-plane. This improves **charge collection efficiency** in planar heterojunction devices.  \n- **Defect Reduction**: Passivation of deep-level traps (e.g., V_I⁻) reduces **voltage losses** (enhancing open-circuit voltage, *Voc*) and suppresses carrier trapping, boosting **fill factor (FF)**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4.

Their roles and effects are rooted in their interactions with perovskite precursors and defects, as detailed below:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Crystallization Kinetics Modulation**  \n**Mechanism**:  \nOrganic ammonium salts act as **kinetic stabilizers** in precursor solutions. They coordinate with lead halide (e.g., PbI₂) precursors via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, delaying nucleation and slowing crystallization. This prolongs the solution’s metastable state, enabling uniform solvent evaporation and extended crystal growth.  \n\n**Interaction**:  \nThe additives form mixed-cationic intermediate complexes (e.g., FA⁺/MA⁺-PbI₃⁻) that compete with the primary perovskite cation (e.g., MA⁺) for incorporation into the lattice.

Defect Passivation**  \n**Mechanism**:  \nOrganic cations can occupy the A-site in the perovskite lattice (ABX₃), substituting for the primary cation (e.g., MA⁺). Their larger ionic radii (e.g., FA⁺ > MA⁺) and structural flexibility enable them to **compensate for lattice strain** and fill vacancies caused by compositional or structural defects (e.g., Pb vacancies, interstitial ions).  \n\n**Interaction**:  \nFA⁺, for instance, preferentially incorporates into regions of high strain, passivating defects such as Pb interstitials or halide vacancies.

Phase Stabilization**  \n**Mechanism**:  \nAdditives influence the **crystallization pathway**, favoring the formation of the desired black-phase perovskite over metastable or non-stoichiometric phases (e.g., δ-phase PbI₂). The mixed-cation environment stabilizes the perovskite structure by reducing lattice mismatch and strain.  \n\n**Interaction**:  \nThe incorporation of larger cations (e.g., FA⁺, Cs⁺) into the A-site increases the bandgap and structural rigidity, enhancing tolerance to halide segregation and moisture-induced degradation.  \n\n**Result**:  \nImproved phase purity and stability under operational conditions, leading to **enhanced photovoltaic performance** and **long-term device stability**.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

    "question": "What are the mechanisms by which organic cation additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells?",
    "reference_answer": "Organic cation additives passivate defects through various mechanisms such as filling vacancies or coordinating with defect sites in perovskite solar cells.",
    "model_output": "Organic cation additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance by mitigating defects through multiple mechanisms rooted in defect physics and crystallization chemistry. These mechanisms include:\n\n### 1. **Substitutional Defect Passivation**  \nOrganic cations (e.g., formamidinium (FA⁺), cesium (Cs⁺), or butylammonium (BA⁺)) substitute at the A-site in the perovskite lattice (ABX₃), displacing smaller or less stable cations like methylammonium (MA⁺). This substitution reduces the formation energy of intrinsic defects such as Pb²⁺ vacancies (V_Pb) or iodine interstitials (I_i). The larger ionic radii of additives like FA⁺ or Cs⁺ reduce lattice strain, stabilizing the perovskite structure and suppressing defect nucleation. For example, FA⁺ incorporation in FAMAPbI₃ systems lowers the density of mid-gap trap states associated with V_Pb, which are major recombination centers.\n\n### 2. **Surface/Grain Boundary Passivation**  \nOrganic cations with bulky alkyl chains (e.g., BA⁺) adsorb onto perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries, forming a protective layer. This physical barrier blocks defect sites at interfaces, preventing charge carrier trapping and non-radiative recombination. The hydrophobic nature of these additives also inhibits moisture-induced degradation, which often generates iodine vacancies (V_I) and other deleterious defects. Additionally, the steric hindrance of bulky cations suppresses ion migration at grain boundaries, reducing dynamic defect formation during operation.\n\n### 3. **Charge Compensation and Trap-State Neutralization**  \nDefects such as V_Pb or I_i create localized charge imbalances that form mid-gap trap states. Organic cations with different ionization potentials or electron affinities can neutralize these charges. For instance, FA⁺ (a weaker oxidizing agent than MA⁺) reduces the likelihood of Pb vacancies by stabilizing the local electronic environment. This neutralization eliminates trap states, restoring the band structure and reducing recombination losses. Cs⁺, with its larger ionic radius, can also screen Coulombic interactions between defects, further suppressing their detrimental effects.\n\n### 4. **Modulation of Crystallization Kinetics**  \nAdditives influence nucleation and crystal growth dynamics. Slow crystallization induced by additives like BA⁺ allows for more ordered perovskite films with fewer grain boundaries and pinholes. Fewer defects in the bulk and at interfaces improve charge carrier mobility and lifetime. For example, phase-pure, large-grained films exhibit reduced density of states at the Fermi level, enhancing open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).\n\n### 5. **Electronic Structure Stabilization**  \nAdditives modulate the electronic properties of the perovskite. Mixed-cation systems (e.g., FA/MA) stabilize the desired black-phase structure, delaying phase segregation and associated defect formation. The altered bandgap and band alignment from cation substitution also reduce interfacial energy barriers, improving charge extraction and reducing voltage losses.\n\n### **Resulting Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \nThese mechanisms collectively reduce non-radiative recombination, enhance charge carrier lifetimes, and improve film homogeneity. The net effect is increased Voc (due to fewer trap states), higher Jsc (via reduced recombination), and improved FF (from better transport and reduced interfacial losses), ultimately elevating the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells.

    "model_output": "**Defect Passivation Mechanisms and Impact on Performance**  \n\n**1. Lithium Iodide (LiI):**  \n- **Mechanism:** Li⁺ ions, due to their small ionic radius (0.76 Å), efficiently occupy interstitial sites or substitute for larger cations (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺) in the perovskite lattice. This mitigates cation vacancies (VA) and iodide vacancies (VI), which are primary recombination centers. Li⁺ also forms strong covalent bonds with I⁻, stabilizing the perovskite structure against phase segregation and halide vacancies. Additionally, LiI can form a passivation layer at the perovskite/HTL interface, reducing interfacial defects.  \n- **Film Quality & Performance:** By suppressing non-radiative recombination, LiI enhances the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and reduces hysteresis. Improved structural stability (e.g., reduced α/β phase transitions) also boosts long-term operational stability.  \n- **Stability:** Li’s strong binding to I⁻ and its role in pinning the lattice suppresses ion migration and degradation pathways, particularly under thermal or moisture stress.  \n\n**2.

These interactions mitigate non-radiative recombination and enhance optoelectronic performance through the following mechanisms:\n\n### **1. Defect Chemistry in Perovskites**  \nPerovskite films (e.g., CH₃NH₃PbI₃) inherently contain defects such as Pb vacancies (V_Pb), iodide vacancies (V_I), and interstitial Pb or halide species. These defects create localized electronic states within the bandgap, acting as recombination centers that trap photogenerated charge carriers. Pb vacancies, in particular, are highly detrimental as they generate deep trap states and promote ion migration under operational conditions.\n\n### **2. Additive-Defect Interactions**  \nAdditives, such as chloride (Cl⁻), formamidinium (HC(NH₂)₂⁺, FA⁺), or organic ligands (e.g., oleic acid), passivate defects via distinct bonding mechanisms:  \n\n- **Substitutional Incorporation into the Lattice**:  \n  Small anions like Cl⁻ substitute for larger halide anions (e.g., I⁻) in the ABX₃ lattice. Cl⁻ binds to Pb²⁺ via stronger ionic interactions (due to its smaller radius and higher electronegativity), filling V_I sites and reducing iodide vacancies. This substitution also stabilizes the perovskite phase by compressing the lattice, suppressing phase segregation (e.g., α/δ phase transitions).  \n\n- **Coordination with Undercoordinated Pb²⁺**:  \n  Additives with Lewis basic groups (e.g., FA⁺, amine-functionalized molecules) form coordination bonds with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ at grain boundaries or surfaces. For example, FA⁺ replaces MA⁺ in the A-site, occupying lattice positions and passivating dangling Pb bonds. Organic ligands (e.g., oleic acid) form chelating complexes with Pb²⁺, capping defect sites and reducing surface trap densities.  \n\n- **Interfacial Passivation**:  \n  Amphiphilic additives (e.g., phenylethylammonium, PEAI) adsorb at perovskite/transport layer interfaces, forming hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions with Pb²⁺ and halide species. This blocks ion diffusion pathways and passivates interfacial defects, improving charge extraction.  \n\n### **3.

This enhances minority carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (Voc).  \n- **Improved Crystallinity**: Additives slow nucleation kinetics, promoting oriented crystal growth with fewer grain boundaries. For instance, FA⁺ incorporation refines grain size and reduces surface roughness.  \n- **Stabilized Structure**: Substitutional Cl⁻ or FA⁺ suppresses ion migration and hysteresis by stabilizing the perovskite lattice. This improves operational stability under light and heat.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nAdditives function by chemically bonding to defect sites through substitutional doping, coordination complexes, or interfacial passivation. These interactions suppress recombination losses, enhance charge transport, and stabilize the perovskite structure, directly translating to higher photovoltaic performance (e.g., Voc, fill factor, and stability).

This chelation or complexation temporarily sequesters these ions, slowing nucleation kinetics.  \n   **Interaction**: Ligands form transient ion-ligand complexes, reducing the local concentration of free ions required for rapid nucleation.  \n   **Result**: Delayed crystallization allows for more uniform nucleation and slower, directional crystal growth, promoting larger grain sizes and reduced defect density.

These sites act as non-radiative recombination centers.  \n   - **Iodine Additive Interaction**: Iodine (I₂) or iodide (I⁻) from the additive reacts with these undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, forming stable PbI₆ octahedra. This reaction fills coordination vacancies and stabilizes the Pb²⁺ environment, reducing defect density.  \n\n### 2. **Filling Halide Vacancies (VA Defects)**  \n   - **VA Defects**: Iodide vacancies (VA) in the perovskite lattice create localized electronic states that trap charge carriers. These defects are common due to halide loss during film processing or phase transitions.  \n   - **I⁻ Incorporation**: Iodide ions from the additive diffuse into the perovskite lattice, occupying VA sites.

    "reference_answer": "Organic molecules with carboxylic acid functional groups can passivate defects in perovskite solar cells by coordinating with metal cations in the perovskite lattice, as the carboxylate groups bind to undercoordinated metal ions, reducing the density of states at the defect sites and decreasing non-radiative recombination losses.",
    "model_output": "Organic molecules with carboxylic acid functional groups (e.g., oleic acid, benzoic acid) act as effective defect passivators in perovskite solar cells through a combination of coordination chemistry and surface passivation mechanisms. Here is the mechanism-grounded explanation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Chemical Interaction with Perovskite Defects**  \nCarboxylic acid groups (-COOH) deprotonate in the perovskite precursor solution or during film annealing, forming carboxylate anions (-COO⁻). These anions coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ cations at defect sites (e.g., Pb vacancies, interfacial regions, or grain boundaries) via chelation. The oxygen atoms in the carboxylate groups bind to Pb²⁺, filling stoichiometric vacancies and passivating trap states. This interaction stabilizes the perovskite lattice by:  \n- **Filling Pb vacancies**: Reducing non-radiative recombination pathways caused by undercoordinated Pb sites.  \n- **Blocking iodide vacancies**: The organic moiety may also interact with undercoordinated halide sites, mitigating halide vacancy-related defects.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Surface Passivation and Grain Boundary Engineering**  \nThe hydrophobic organic tail of the molecule (e.g., alkyl or aromatic groups) forms a self-assembled monolayer on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. This layer:  \n- **Blocks moisture and oxygen ingress**: Reducing oxidative degradation and hydrolysis at the surface.  \n- **Passivates surface dipoles**: Neutralizing mid-gap states caused by undercoordinated surface Pb or halide ions, which otherwise act as electron/hole traps.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Reduced defect density**: Coordination with Pb²⁺ and surface passivation suppress non-radiative recombination, increasing the minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length.  \n- **Improved crystallinity**: Additives can modulate nucleation kinetics, promoting larger grain growth and fewer grain boundaries, which are hotspots for defects.  \n- **Enhanced optoelectronic properties**: Passivation reduces mid-gap states, improving open-circuit voltage (\\(V_{\\text{oc}}\\)) and fill factor (\\(FF\\)), while maintaining high light absorption.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Outcomes**  \nThe synergistic action of carboxylate coordination and organic passivation results in:  \n- **Higher photoluminescence quantum yields** (PLQY) due to reduced recombination.  \n- **Lower trap-state densities** (measured via time-resolved photoluminescence or deep-level transient spectroscopy).  \n- **Stabilized device performance** under operational stress, as passivation mitigates degradation pathways.  \n\nThis mechanism underscores the importance of functional group design in additives for achieving high-efficiency, stable perovskite optoelectronics.",

These sites act as electron traps due to their unsaturated coordination environment, promoting charge recombination.  \n\n2. **Additive Action**:  \n   Excess iodide ions (I⁻) from the additive (e.g., DIPE/I₂, MAI, or CsI) preferentially bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ at defect sites. The I⁻ ions coordinate with Pb²⁺ to form **Pb-I coordination complexes**, restoring local stoichiometry and passivating the defect. For Pb vacancies, interstitial I⁻ may stabilize the lattice by filling interstitial sites adjacent to VPb, reducing the electrostatic potential that drives recombination.  \n\n3. **Passivation Chemistry**:  \n   The interaction involves **ligand exchange** or **stoichiometric compensation**:  \n   - At Pb vacancies: I⁻ forms **I⁻-Pb-I⁻ bridges** across VPb, reducing trap states.  \n   - At undercoordinated Pb: I⁻ acts as a **capping ligand**, saturating dangling bonds and suppressing trap-assisted recombination.  \n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance:  \n- **Reduced Defect Density**: Passivation minimizes midgap states, lowering non-radiative recombination losses.  \n- **Improved Morphology**: I⁻ additives can also modulate crystallization kinetics, promoting larger grains and fewer pinholes, enhancing carrier diffusion lengths.  \n- **Enhanced Stability**: The stabilized Pb-I coordination resists ion migration and halide vacancies under operational stress, improving long-term stability.  \n\nThis mechanism directly correlates with increased open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells by suppressing defects and optimizing interfacial energetics.",

    "question": "How do halide anions like chloride (Cl⁻), bromide (Br⁻), and iodide (I⁻) function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells, and what is their impact on device performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability?",
    "reference_answer": "Halide anions such as chloride (Cl⁻), bromide (Br⁻), and iodide (I⁻) act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by influencing the crystallization process and film morphology. They can replace the halide ions in the perovskite lattice, which affects the crystal structure and grain size. This modification leads to improved charge transport properties, reduced defect states, and enhanced device performance. In terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE), the presence of these anions can optimize the absorption spectrum and improve the charge extraction efficiency, thus boosting the overall PCE. Regarding stability, the formation of more stable perovskite structures with these anions can enhance the long-term stability of the perovskite solar cells under various operating conditions.",
    "model_output": "Halide anions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by modulating crystallization kinetics, defect chemistry, and optoelectronic properties, thereby influencing power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. Their roles are mechanistically distinct and interdependent:\n\n### **1. Defect Passivation and Charge Carrier Dynamics**  \nHalide additives substitute into the perovskite lattice (e.g., MAPbI₃ → MAPb(I₁₋ₓClₓ)₃), where smaller-radius Cl⁻ ions preferentially occupy interstitial sites or replace I⁻ in the lattice. This substitution passivates intrinsic defects such as iodide vacancies (VI⁻) and interstitial Pb²⁺, which are major sources of non-radiative recombination. Cl⁻ also stabilizes the surface by passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ at grain boundaries, reducing trap states. Br⁻, with an intermediate radius, similarly mitigates defects but less effectively than Cl⁻. By suppressing recombination losses, these additives enhance charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, boosting open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).\n\n### **2. Bandgap Tuning via Halide Gradients**  \nMixing halides (e.g., I⁻/Br⁻ or I⁻/Cl⁻) enables compositional grading in the perovskite film. During crystallization, halide segregation driven by thermodynamic stability differences (e.g., Cl-rich regions forming at the surface due to lower surface energy) creates a graded bandgap. This gradient enhances light absorption and carrier extraction: the narrower bandgap (higher I⁻ content) at the bulk absorbs near-infrared photons, while the wider bandgap (Cl/Br-rich surface) reduces non-radiative losses and improves Voc. Such tuning optimizes the absorption profile, elevating PCE.\n\n### **3. Crystallization Kinetics and Film Morphology**  \nHalides influence nucleation and grain growth. Cl⁻ slows crystallization by delaying MA⁺/Pb²⁺ complex formation, promoting large, pinhole-free grains with fewer grain boundaries—sites of defect accumulation and ion migration pathways. Larger grains reduce recombination and improve carrier transport, enhancing PCE. Br⁻ can also modulate crystallization but may promote phase segregation if not homogeneously mixed, potentially degrading stability. I⁻, as the primary component, dictates lattice expansion but requires additives to mitigate its inherent instability.\n\n### **4. Phase Stability and Environmental Resistance**  \nCl⁻ incorporation stabilizes the δ-phase (a mixed-cation, low-temperature phase) or suppresses α-phase formation, which is prone to ion migration and moisture degradation. The smaller Cl⁻ ions also form stronger Pb–X bonds, reducing halide vacancy concentrations and mitigating ion migration under operational stresses (e.g., heat, light). Br⁻ enhances tolerance to moisture and thermal degradation compared to pure I⁻-based perovskites but may induce halide phase segregation under illumination, compromising long-term stability. I⁻-rich perovskites degrade rapidly due to hydrolysis and ion mobility, underscoring the need for halide additives to stabilize the structure.\n\n### **Impact on Device Performance**  \n- **PCE**: Cl⁻/Br⁻ additives enhance Voc (via bandgap grading and defect passivation), FF (via reduced recombination and improved morphology), and Jsc (via optimized absorption), leading to PCEs exceeding 25%.  \n- **Stability**: Cl⁻ significantly improves operational stability by passivating defects and retarding ion migration, while Br⁻ offers moderate stability benefits. However, improper halide mixing can induce phase segregation, reducing stability. I⁻-based cells degrade rapidly without additives.  \n\nIn summary, halide additives synergistically optimize crystallization, defect density, and phase stability, directly linking their chemical interactions with perovskite lattice dynamics to enhanced optoelectronic performance and durability.",

    "model_output": "**Mechanisms of FAI-Based Additives with Organic Cations (e.g., DMF) in Enhancing Charge Carrier Mobility and Extraction in Perovskite Solar Cells**\n\n1. **Controlled Crystallization and Grain Growth**  \n   FAI and organic cations like DMF act as crystallization modifiers in the perovskite precursor solution. FAI, when introduced as an additive, slows nucleation kinetics by forming transient complexes with Pb²⁺ ions or stabilizing intermediate phases (e.g., PbI₂). This delays perovskite nucleation, promoting homogeneous crystal growth and larger grain sizes. Organic cations (e.g., DMF) may further modulate surface energy and growth anisotropy, favoring 2D-to-3D phase evolution. Larger grains reduce grain boundary density, minimizing recombination sites and enabling longer carrier diffusion lengths, thereby enhancing mobility.\n\n2. **Defect Passivation via Iodide Vacancy and Interstitial Site Stabilization**  \n   FAI supplies formamidinium (FA⁺) cations that substitute into the perovskite lattice, filling cation vacancies and suppressing iodide vacancy formation. Iodide vacancies (V_I) are major non-radiative recombination centers in perovskites. FA⁺ insertion reduces their concentration, lowering trap-state densities. Organic cations (e.g., DMF) may coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites or halide interstitials via hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions, passivating these defects. This reduces recombination losses, increasing carrier lifetime and mobility.\n\n3. **Surface Morphology Optimization**  \n   DMF, as an additive, can act as a surfactant, adsorbing at crystal surfaces and edges to suppress roughness and pinhole formation during film deposition. A smoother surface morphology improves the interface with charge transport layers (e.g., spiro-OMeTAD or PCBM), reducing contact resistance and enhancing charge extraction efficiency. Additionally, FAI may promote denser film packing by modulating solvent evaporation dynamics, further minimizing surface defects.\n\n4. **Stabilization of Mixed-Cation Perovskite Phases**  \n   FAI introduces mixed cations (e.g., FA⁺/MA⁺/Cs⁺) into the perovskite lattice, stabilizing the α-phase (highly conductive) over metastable or defective phases. The organic cations (e.g., DMF) may assist in homogenizing cation distribution, preventing phase segregation. This phase purity ensures uniform electronic properties across the film, reducing localized recombination and improving bulk carrier mobility.\n\n5. **Suppression of Non-Radiative Recombination Channels**  \n   The combined action of FAI and organic cations reduces defect-mediated recombination pathways. FA⁺ substitution and organic cation passivation lower the density of deep-level traps, shifting the density of states toward mid-gap states. This enhances the effective mobility by reducing scattering events and improving carrier transport across the film.\n\n**Resulting Influence on Device Performance**  \nThese mechanisms collectively improve charge carrier mobility by minimizing recombination losses and enhancing carrier lifetimes. The reduced series resistance from smoother interfaces and lower trap densities boosts charge extraction efficiency. Consequently, devices exhibit higher open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FF), and power conversion efficiencies (PCE), with enhanced operational stability due to defect mitigation and phase stability.\n\n**Key Interactions**  \n- **FAI**: Donates FA⁺ cations to the lattice, modulates crystallization kinetics, and passivates V_I defects.  \n- **Organic cations (e.g., DMF)**: Act as surfactants, stabilize growth fronts, and passivate surface/interfacial defects via coordination or hydrogen bonding.  \n\nThis synergistic interplay between additive chemistry and perovskite structure underpins the observed improvements in optoelectronic performance.",

    "model_output": "### Mechanisms of Defect Passivation by Precursor Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells  \n\nPrecursor additives mitigate defects in perovskite films through **chemical coordination**, **surface passivation**, **crystallization control**, and **electronic structure modulation**, each mechanism addressing distinct defect types and their impact on optoelectronic performance.  \n\n#### 1. **Defect Site Coordination**  \nAdditives such as organic cations (e.g., formamidinium (FA⁺), guanidinium (GA⁺)) or small molecules (e.g., choline iodide) bind to undercoordinated metal or halide ions at defect sites (e.g., Pb²⁺ vacancies or interstitial I⁻). These additives act as **ligands**, forming coordination bonds with dangling bonds at vacancies or grain boundaries. For instance, FA⁺ can substitute for MA⁺ in the perovskite lattice, filling MA⁺ vacancies that would otherwise act as electron traps. Similarly, choline iodide’s hydroxyl groups hydrogen-bond with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, passivating these sites and reducing mid-gap trap states. This coordination suppresses non-radiative recombination, enhancing charge carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (*Voc*).  \n\n#### 2. **Surface Passivation**  \nAdditives such as oleic acid or phenethylamine adsorb onto perovskite surfaces, forming a protective layer that blocks reactive surface sites. These surface defects (e.g., undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or halide vacancies) are major recombination centers. The additive molecules sterically hinder water or oxygen from accessing these sites, preventing oxidation or hydrolysis-driven defect formation. Surface passivation reduces interfacial recombination losses, improving *Voc* and fill factor (*FF*).  \n\n#### 3. **Crystallization Control**  \nAdditives (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)) slow nucleation and growth kinetics during film formation, promoting **large, uniform grains** with fewer grain boundaries. Grain boundaries are defect-rich regions with high trap densities; reducing their abundance lowers non-radiative recombination pathways. Additionally, additives may stabilize the perovskite phase (e.g., by delaying solvent evaporation), suppressing the formation of non-perovskite phases (e.g., PbI₂), which are electronically inactive and defect-prone. Enhanced crystallinity improves carrier diffusion lengths and overall device efficiency.  \n\n#### 4. **Electronic Structure Modulation**  \nSome additives (e.g., phenyltrifluorosilane (PTFS)) dope the perovskite or shift its Fermi level, modulating the electronic band structure. For example, PTFS introduces fluorine-based passivation at Pb²⁺ sites, reducing the density of mid-gap states caused by halide vacancies. This adjustment narrows the bandgap slightly while suppressing trap-assisted recombination. Other additives, such as ammonium (NH₄⁺), can dope the valence band, reducing the density of hole traps and improving charge extraction.  \n\n#### 5. **Impurity Scavenging**  \nAdditives like chlorine or cesium (Cs⁺) scavenge impurities (e.g., residual PbI₂ or solvent residues) that would otherwise form defects. Chlorine, for instance, substitutes for iodide in the lattice, stabilizing the perovskite structure and reducing iodide vacancy defects. Cs⁺ incorporation suppresses MA⁺ segregation at surfaces, minimizing trap states.  \n\n### Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance  \nThese mechanisms collectively reduce **non-radiative recombination**, enhance **charge carrier mobility**, and improve **crystallinity**, leading to higher *Voc*, *FF*, and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).

For instance, cesium iodide (CsI) introduces Cs⁺ ions into the A-site of the perovskite lattice (e.g., forming FA₀.₈Cs₀.₂PbI₃), displacing labile organic cations (e.g., MA⁺/FA⁺). This substitution stabilizes the perovskite phase by reducing compositional fluctuations and suppressing non-perovskite phases (e.g., α-PbI₂ or δ-PbI₂), which are prone to defect formation. The additive also provides excess halide ions (e.g., I⁻), ensuring stoichiometric completeness during crystallization, which minimizes iodine vacancies (V_I⁻) and interstitial Pb²⁺ defects.\n\n### 2. **Defect Passivation via Ion Substitution and Stoichiometric Compensation**  \n- **Iodine Vacancy Passivation**: Iodine vacancies (V_I⁻) are major non-radiative recombination centers in perovskites.

Improved stability by mitigating ion migration at interfaces.  \n\n#### 2. **Mixed-Cation Additives**  \n   - **Examples**: Cesium (Cs⁺), rubidium (Rb⁺), or formamidinium (FA⁺).  \n   - **Mechanism**: These cations replace a fraction of the organic cations (e.g., MA⁺) in the perovskite lattice, stabilizing the black-phase (ferroelectric) structure over the less conductive yellow phase.  \n   - **Interaction**: Cs⁺/Rb⁺ occupy the A-site lattice, increasing lattice strain and suppressing phase segregation. FA⁺ enhances tolerance to moisture and thermal stress.  \n   - **Effect**: Improved phase stability, suppressed hysteresis, and enhanced carrier mobility. Mixed-cation perovskites (e.g., FA₀.₈₅Cs₀.₁₅Pb(I₀.₈Br₀.₂)₃) achieve record efficiencies by balancing bandgap and stability.  \n\n#### 3. **Halide Additives**  \n   - **Examples**: Bromide (Br⁻), chloride (Cl⁻).  \n   - **Mechanism**: Halide substitution tunes the bandgap (e.g., Br⁻ narrows the bandgap compared to pure I⁻), optimizing light absorption. Br⁻ also stabilizes the perovskite structure by reducing lattice mismatch.  \n   - **Interaction**: Br⁻/Cl⁻ substitutes I⁻ in the B-site, altering electronic structure and defect formation energy. Excess Cl⁻ can segregate to grain boundaries, passivating interfacial defects.  \n   - **Effect**: Enhanced light harvesting (via bandgap tuning) and reduced trap-state density. However, excessive halide segregation can induce phase separation.  \n\n#### 4. **Surfactants and Capping Agents**  \n   - **Examples**: Oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OAm), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).  \n   - **Mechanism**: These additives control nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, promoting large, oriented grains and minimizing pinholes.  \n   - **Interaction**: Surfactants adsorb onto perovskite precursor surfaces, slowing crystallization and enabling defect-free grain growth. Capping agents inhibit lateral growth, favoring vertical crystal expansion.  \n   - **Effect**: Improved film morphology (smooth surfaces, reduced grain boundaries) enhances charge transport and reduces recombination at defects.  \n\n#### 5. **Inorganic Passivators**  \n   - **Examples**: SnO₂ nanoparticles, Zn(OH)₂, or cesium lead halide (CsPbX₃) quantum dots.  \n   - **Mechanism**: Inorganic nanoparticles passivate surface defects or act as interfacial layers, reducing interfacial charge recombination.

    "question": "What are post - deposition additives in perovskite solar cells and how do they function to passivate defects and improve device performance?",
    "reference_answer": "Post - deposition additives are substances applied after the perovskite film formation. They passivate defects by interacting with defect sites on the perovskite surface, for example through chemical bonding or charge transfer, and improve device performance by reducing non - radiative recombination losses and enhancing charge carrier mobility.",
    "model_output": "Post-deposition additives in perovskite solar cells are chemical compounds applied to the perovskite film *after* crystallization to mitigate intrinsic defects and enhance optoelectronic properties. These additives function by passivating defect sites through coordination chemistry and surface/interface engineering, thereby improving charge transport and reducing non-radiative recombination.\n\n### **Mechanism of Defect Passivation**  \n1. **Coordination with Undercoordinated Ions**:  \n   Perovskite films (e.g., CH₃NH₃PbI₃) often contain defects such as iodine vacancies (V_I) or lead interstitials, which act as electron traps. Post-deposition additives, such as bulky amines (e.g., 4-tert-butylpyridine, 4-TBP) or carboxylic acids (e.g., oleic acid), bind to undercoordinated Pb²⁺ or Sn²⁺ ions at defect sites. The additive’s functional groups (e.g., pyridine N or carboxylate O) form coordination bonds with these ions, filling the vacancy or stabilizing the interstitial, thereby neutralizing the trap states.  \n\n2. **Surface Passivation**:  \n   Surface defects (e.g., dangling bonds at grain boundaries) are passivated by additives forming a self-assembled monolayer. For instance, additives like phenethylamine (PEA⁺) intercalate into the perovskite lattice or adsorb on surfaces, shielding reactive sites from environmental degradation (e.g., moisture) and reducing surface recombination.  \n\n3. **Grain Boundary Engineering**:  \n   Some additives (e.g., benzylamine) promote grain growth during post-annealing, reducing the density of grain boundaries—a major source of defects. Larger grain sizes enhance charge carrier diffusion lengths and reduce recombination losses.  \n\n### **Interaction with Perovskite Components**  \nAdditives selectively target defect sites due to their chemical affinity. For example, 4-TBP’s bulky tert-butyl group sterically blocks water/moisture from accessing Pb sites, while its pyridine N coordinates to Pb²⁺, passivating V_I. This dual role stabilizes the perovskite phase and suppresses ion migration.  \n\n### **Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Reduced Non-Radiative Recombination**: Passivation of trap states lowers the density of midgap states, increasing open-circuit voltage (*Voc*) by improving carrier lifetime.  \n- **Enhanced Charge Transport**: Fewer defects and larger grains reduce carrier scattering, boosting short-circuit current density (*Jsc*) and fill factor (*FF*).  \n- **Stability Improvement**: Surface passivation and defect mitigation delay degradation from environmental exposure, enhancing operational stability.  \n\n### **Example: 4-TBP Additive**  \n4-TBP’s coordination with Pb²⁺ at V_I sites reduces electron trapping, while its steric hindrance inhibits moisture-induced decomposition. This results in a smoother, more homogenous film with reduced hysteresis and improved *Voc* (e.g., from ~1.1 V to 1.2 V in MAPbI₃ cells).  \n\nIn summary, post-deposition additives function via defect passivation and structural optimization, directly addressing the optoelectronic limitations of perovskites to achieve higher efficiency and stability in photovoltaic devices.",

    "question": "What is the role of iodide ions provided by ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) additives in perovskite crystallization?",
    "reference_answer": "Iodide ions from ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are crucial for the formation of the perovskite crystal structure. NH₄I acts as a source of iodide ions to control the crystallization process by providing an iodide concentration gradient, and FAI provides iodide ions along with the formamidinium cation which can influence the stoichiometry and crystal lattice of the perovskite, together assisting in achieving a well - defined perovskite morphology during crystallization.",
    "model_output": "The role of iodide ions (I⁻) from ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) additives in perovskite crystallization is multifaceted, rooted in stoichiometric compensation, defect passivation, and phase stabilization. Here is a structured explanation:\n\n### **1. Stoichiometric Compensation and Defect Suppression**  \nPerovskite crystallization from precursor solutions often involves PbI₂ and organic cations (e.g., FA⁺, MA⁺). However, incomplete stoichiometry or kinetic limitations during nucleation/growth can lead to iodide vacancies (I⁻ defects) in the ABX₃ lattice. These vacancies act as electron traps, increasing non-radiative recombination and degrading optoelectronic performance.  \n- **Mechanism**: NH₄I and FAI provide excess I⁻ ions to the solution, ensuring a stoichiometric excess of halide relative to Pb²⁺. This suppresses iodide vacancy formation by maintaining local I⁻ supersaturation during crystallization.  \n- **Defect Passivation**: Excess I⁻ can also occupy interstitial sites or fill vacancies in the lattice, passivating defects and reducing trap states. This improves charge carrier lifetime and reduces hysteresis in perovskite films.\n\n### **2. Phase Stabilization and Morphology Control**  \nNon-perovskite phases (e.g., α-PbI₂, δ-PbI₂) often form during crystallization due to kinetic trapping, particularly in regions of I⁻ deficiency. These phases degrade film homogeneity and optoelectronic properties.  \n- **Mechanism**: Excess I⁻ from additives stabilizes the perovskite phase by shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium toward the desired cubic/orthorhombic structure. It also inhibits the nucleation of non-perovskite phases by maintaining solution-phase I⁻ concentration above critical thresholds.  \n- **Crystallization Kinetics**: I⁻ ions may act as nucleation sites or growth modifiers, promoting oriented crystal growth and reducing grain boundaries. This enhances film crystallinity and reduces surface roughness.\n\n### **3. Ion Migration and Post-Annealing Defect Healing**  \nDuring annealing, perovskite films undergo structural relaxation and defect annihilation. Excess I⁻ facilitates ionic mobility, enabling defect healing through vacancy diffusion and recombination.  \n- **Mechanism**: Mobile I⁻ ions can migrate to defect sites (e.g., Pb vacancies) under thermal gradients, filling vacancies and restoring stoichiometry. This process is particularly critical in mitigating PbI₂-rich regions that form during annealing.  \n\n### **4. Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance**  \n- **Film Quality**: The combined effects of stoichiometric balance, phase purity, and defect passivation result in dense, pinhole-free films with large grain sizes and reduced trap densities.  \n- **Device Performance**: Improved charge carrier mobility and reduced recombination enhance open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). The suppression of non-radiative pathways also elevates photoluminescence (PL) intensity and quantum yield.\n\n### **Summary**  \nNH₄I and FAI additives supply I⁻ ions that:  \n1. Compensate for stoichiometric deficits, suppressing iodide vacancies and non-perovskite phases.  \n2. Facilitate defect passivation and ionic healing during crystallization and post-annealing.  \n3. Optimize film morphology and optoelectronic properties, directly enhancing device performance.  \n\nThis mechanism underscores the critical role of halide stoichiometry and defect engineering in achieving high-quality perovskite films.",

    "reference_answer": "Organic cation-based additives usually contain simple organic cations like methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), with a relatively simple chemical nature that mainly function by controlling crystallization and passivating defects through electrostatic interactions. MOF-based additives have a more complex chemical structure with metal ions coordinated to organic ligands and can influence perovskite formation through multiple mechanisms such as providing reaction sites, regulating ion transport, and enhancing intermolecular interactions.",
    "model_output": "### Organic Cation-Based Additives  \n**Chemical Nature**: Organic cation-based additives are typically small organic molecules (e.g., guanidinium (Gua+), formamidinium (FA+), or thiocyanate (SCN−)) or surfactants (e.g., oleic acid, oleylamine) that can reversibly bind to perovskite precursors or incorporate into the perovskite lattice.  \n\n**Functions and Mechanisms**:  \n1. **Defect Passivation**: These additives complex with halide precursors (e.g., PbI₂) in the solution phase, delaying nucleation and slowing crystallization kinetics. This allows for larger, more uniform grain growth, reducing defect-dense grain boundaries. Upon annealing, some cations (e.g., Gua+) substitute for organic cations in the perovskite lattice (e.g., MA⁺ in CH₃NH₃PbI₃), passivating iodine vacancies (V_I) and interfacial defects.  \n2. **Solvent Engineering**: Surfactant-like additives (e.g., oleic acid) form hydrogen bonds with halide precursors, modulating solvent evaporation rates and promoting smooth film morphology by suppressing Ostwald ripening.  \n3. **Stabilization**: Incorporation of bulky organic cations (e.g., FA⁺) into the lattice reduces lattice strain and improves thermal stability by disrupting phase segregation in mixed-cation perovskites.  \n\n**Impact on Performance**: Enhanced charge carrier lifetime, reduced non-radiative recombination, and improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to defect mitigation. Larger grain sizes also reduce trap-assisted recombination at grain boundaries, boosting overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).  \n\n---\n\n### Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)-Based Additives  \n**Chemical Nature**: MOFs are porous crystalline materials composed of metal clusters (e.g., Zr⁴⁺, Al³⁺) linked by organic ligands (e.g., benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate). Examples include UiO-66 (Zr-based) or MIL-101 (Cr-based).  \n\n**Functions and Mechanisms**:  \n1. **Crystallization Template**: The rigid, ordered MOF structure acts as a scaffold, directing perovskite nucleation and growth along specific crystallographic orientations (e.g., (110) planes), resulting in highly aligned, pinhole-free films.  \n2. **Defect Passivation**: MOF ligands (e.g., carboxylate groups) coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at perovskite surfaces or grain boundaries, passivating halide vacancies and reducing trap states. Metal nodes in the MOF may also supply dopants (e.g., Zr⁴⁺) that substitute for Pb²⁺, stabilizing the perovskite lattice.  \n3. **Environmental Barrier**: The porous MOF matrix physically traps moisture and oxygen, delaying degradation pathways (e.g., hydrolysis of Pb-I bonds). Additionally, MOFs can sequester excess halide ions, preventing halide segregation that degrades optoelectronic properties.  \n4. **Solvent Retention**: MOF porosity slows solvent evaporation during spin-coating, enabling homogeneous precursor distribution and reducing phase separation in mixed-halide systems (e.g., FA₀.₈MA₀.₂Pb(I₀.₈Br₀.₂)₃).  \n\n**Impact on Performance**: Improved film homogeneity, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced stability under thermal/moisture stress. MOFs also suppress non-radiative recombination at interfaces, elevating Voc and fill factor (FF).  \n\n---\n\n### Summary  \nOrganic cations primarily function at the molecular level, modulating crystallization kinetics and lattice defects, while MOFs operate structurally, guiding morphology and providing environmental protection. Both classes of additives synergistically address critical challenges in perovskite film quality and device stability, underpinning advancements in solar cell efficiency and durability.",
