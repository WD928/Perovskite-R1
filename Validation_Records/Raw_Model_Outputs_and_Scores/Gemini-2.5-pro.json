    "reference_answer": "Organic ammonium salts like formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) act as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells by incorporating into the perovskite lattice during the synthesis process. They passivate defects through charge compensation, where their cations balance the charge of defects, reducing non-radiative recombination losses. For crystallization, they influence the growth kinetics and morphology of perovskite crystals, promoting a more ordered structure. This leads to improved charge carrier mobility and better device performance, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells.",
    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts, such as formamidinium iodide (FAI) or methylammonium chloride (MACl), function as critical precursor additives by fundamentally altering the perovskite crystallization pathway and providing post-formation defect passivation. The underlying mechanism involves the formation of intermediate complexes in the precursor solution, where excess halide anions (e.g., I⁻, Cl⁻) act as Lewis bases that coordinate with unsaturated Pb²⁺ Lewis acid sites in lead-halide colloids, thereby increasing the activation energy for nucleation and retarding rapid, uncontrolled crystal growth. This controlled crystallization kinetic promotes the formation of a high-quality polycrystalline film characterized by larger, more oriented grains, reduced grain boundary density, and a superior surface morphology. Upon film formation, the excess organic cations and halide ions interact directly with the perovskite lattice to passivate detrimental point defects; surplus halides fill halide vacancies (V_X⁺), and organic cations can passivate lead vacancies (V_Pb²⁻) or undercoordinated lead ions at surfaces and grain boundaries, which are primary sites for non-radiative charge recombination. The consequential impact on device performance is a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), driven primarily by a higher open-circuit voltage (V_oc) due to the suppression of trap-assisted recombination and an improved fill factor (FF) from reduced charge transport resistance. Moreover, this dual role of crystallization control and defect passivation substantially improves device stability by mitigating ion migration under electrical bias and light soaking, while also fortifying the perovskite film against degradation from extrinsic factors like moisture and oxygen.",

    "reference_answer": "Key chemical groups in perovskite precursor additives for defect passivation include carboxylates, amines, and halides. Carboxylates (-COO-) can coordinate with metal cations in perovskite lattices, filling vacancies and reducing non-radiative recombination centers. Amines (-NH₂ or -NR₂) can form hydrogen bonds with perovskite surfaces, disrupting defect-induced charge trapping states. Halides (such as iodide I⁻) can participate in ion exchange reactions with surface defects, compensating for charged states and improving charge transport. These interactions passivate defects, enhance charge carrier mobility, and improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells.",

The underlying mechanism involves the donation of lone-pair electrons from these functional groups to the empty orbitals of undercoordinated lead (Pb2+) ions, which are prevalent Lewis acidic defect sites on perovskite crystal surfaces and at grain boundaries. This interaction effectively neutralizes deep-level electronic trap states associated with these defects, thereby suppressing non-radiative charge carrier recombination. Concurrently, other additives like long-chain alkylammonium halides or supplementary halide anions (e.g., Cl⁻) interact with the material by passivating negatively charged surface defects, filling halide vacancies, and influencing crystallite growth. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted: the reduction in trap density significantly increases carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, leading to a substantial enhancement in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), which elevates the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).

This coordination forms stable Lewis acid-base adducts, effectively passivating these charge recombination centers. Simultaneously, this interaction modulates the perovskite crystallization kinetics by forming intermediate complexes (e.g., PbI₂-additive) in the precursor solution, which increases the Gibbs free energy of nucleation, thereby slowing down the rapid, uncontrolled crystal growth to yield films with higher crystallinity, larger grain sizes, and preferential orientation. Furthermore, ionic additives, such as alkali metal halides or bulky organic ammonium halides, directly interact with the perovskite lattice; excess halide anions fill halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺), a prevalent and mobile defect, while specific cations can suppress ion migration or, in the case of large organic cations, self-assemble at the film's surface and grain boundaries to form low-dimensional passivation layers. The consequential impact on device performance is substantial: the reduction in trap-state density via passivation suppresses non-radiative recombination, leading to a significant increase in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF), which are primary drivers for enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE). Concurrently, the improved film morphology with fewer grain boundaries enhances charge transport and collection, boosting the short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀). Critically, these passivation strategies, particularly the suppression of mobile ion vacancies and the formation of hydrophobic surface layers, mitigate intrinsic degradation pathways, leading to a marked improvement in the device's operational and environmental stability against moisture, oxygen, heat, and light-induced degradation.",

LiTFSI, a lithium salt, functions primarily through an ionic mechanism where Li⁺ ions, acting as Lewis acids, coordinate with precursor components to control nucleation and growth, while also serving as a p-dopant to enhance charge extraction. This interaction involves the intercalation of small Li⁺ cations into the perovskite lattice or their segregation at grain boundaries, where they passivate negatively charged defects like lead vacancies (V_Pb²⁻), while the bulky TFSI⁻ anion passivates positively charged defects such as halide vacancies (V_I⁺) at surfaces and grain boundaries. Consequently, LiTFSI reduces non-radiative recombination and improves hole transport, leading to an enhanced Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), although the hygroscopic nature and mobility of Li⁺ can introduce long-term stability concerns. In contrast, FAI and MAI are organic halide salts that act as both compositional building blocks and defect passivators. FAI is incorporated to form mixed-cation perovskites, where the larger formamidinium cation tunes the Goldschmidt tolerance factor to stabilize the photoactive cubic α-phase, resulting in a more thermally stable lattice with a narrower, more favorable bandgap. Excess MAI or FAI in the precursor solution creates a halide-rich chemical environment during film formation, which effectively suppresses the formation of deep-level trap states associated with V_I⁺ and lead-iodide antisite defects (Pb_I). This compositional and stoichiometric control directly impacts crystallization, promoting the growth of larger, more oriented grains with fewer boundaries, thereby minimizing charge carrier scattering and recombination.

The consequential impact on device performance is therefore multifaceted: the suppression of trap-assisted recombination directly increases the quasi-Fermi level splitting, leading to a substantial enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀), while the improved film morphology facilitates more efficient charge transport and extraction, elevating both the short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀) and the fill factor (FF). Ultimately, this dual action of crystallographic control and defect passivation not only boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also enhances the intrinsic and operational stability of the device by mitigating ion migration and suppressing degradation pathways initiated at defect sites.",

    "model_output": "Organic acids function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells primarily through a mechanism of Lewis acid-base coordination, which modulates the crystallization kinetics and provides defect passivation. The carboxylate functional group (-COOH) of the acid acts as a Lewis base, forming a transient intermediate complex with the Lewis acidic lead(II) ions (Pb²⁺) in the precursor solution. This coordination increases the Gibbs free energy of nucleation, thereby retarding the rapid, uncontrolled reaction between the lead halide and the organic cation, which allows for a more ordered crystallization process. This controlled growth results in a perovskite film with superior morphology, characterized by larger, more oriented crystal grains and a significantly reduced density of grain boundaries. Concurrently, the organic acid molecules or their deprotonated anions serve as powerful passivating agents by coordinating with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, which are prevalent at grain boundaries and on the film surface, effectively neutralizing these deep-level trap states that would otherwise act as non-radiative recombination centers. The consequential impact on device performance is a substantial enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), driven primarily by a higher open-circuit voltage (Vₒc) due to suppressed non-radiative recombination and an improved fill factor (FF) from enhanced charge transport and reduced series resistance.

This layer can fill in vacancies and trap dangling bonds, reducing non-radiative recombination losses. The additives also help to control the crystallization process, leading to more uniform and high-quality perovskite films. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved due to reduced charge carrier recombination and enhanced charge extraction, and device stability is enhanced as the passivated defects are less likely to cause degradation over time.",

They act as solvents for perovskite precursors, aiding in the dissolution of lead halide and organic cation components. Their mechanism involves forming hydrogen bonds with the precursor molecules, which helps in the homogeneous mixing of the solution. This leads to better crystallization control, as the solvents can influence the growth rate and orientation of perovskite crystals. For MAI, it is an organic cation source. It reacts with lead halide precursors to form perovskite structures. Its mechanism is based on ionic bonding, where it provides the organic cation framework within the perovskite lattice. This affects the overall structure and properties of the perovskite, influencing charge transport and stability. Overall, these additives can improve the solubility of precursors, enhance the crystallization process, passivate defects, and increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells by modifying the chemical environment during perovskite formation.",
    "model_output": "The chemical nature and mechanism of action of common perovskite precursor additives are primarily governed by Lewis acid-base interactions and stoichiometric control, which profoundly influence crystallization kinetics and defect chemistry. Specifically, polar aprotic solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a strong Lewis base, form stable intermediate adducts (e.g., PbI₂·DMSO) with lead halide precursors through coordination between its sulfoxide oxygen and the Pb²⁺ cation. This intermediate phase retards the rapid reaction with the organic cation, facilitating a more controlled crystallization process upon annealing that results in larger grain sizes, superior film morphology, and reduced pinhole density. In contrast, the weaker coordinating nature of dimethylformamide (DMF) leads to faster, less controlled crystallization, often necessitating its use in conjunction with DMSO. Concurrently, excess methylammonium iodide (MAI), when used as a stoichiometric additive, directly addresses intrinsic point defects within the perovskite lattice; the surplus iodide ions (I⁻) effectively passivate positively charged iodide vacancies (V_I⁺), while excess methylammonium cations (MA⁺) can compensate for negatively charged lead-iodide antisite defects (Pb_I) and methylammonium vacancies (V_MA⁻). This dual approach of crystallization control and defect passivation synergistically suppresses trap-assisted non-radiative recombination, leading to a significant enhancement in device power conversion efficiency (PCE), primarily through improved open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF).

    "model_output": "Common perovskite precursor additives, broadly categorized as Lewis bases, ionic salts, and large organic cations, function by passivating electronic defects and modulating the crystallization process to enhance film quality. The underlying mechanism for Lewis base additives, such as thiourea, caffeine, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), involves the coordination of their electron-donating functional groups (e.g., C=S, C=O, S=O) with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, which act as Lewis acid sites and deep-level electron traps. This interaction forms stable intermediate Lewis acid-base adducts with lead halides (e.g., PbI₂·DMSO), which retards the rapid perovskite crystallization kinetics, thereby promoting the growth of larger, more uniform grains with a lower density of grain boundaries. Ionic salt additives, including alkali metal halides (e.g., KCl, RbI) and ammonium halides (e.g., NH₄Cl), interact with the lattice by providing supplemental halide ions to fill prevalent halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺), a primary source of non-radiative recombination, while cations can occupy interstitial sites or substitute A-site cations to relieve lattice strain and suppress phase segregation. Concurrently, large organic cations like phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) or guanidinium iodide (GAI) are sterically hindered from incorporating into the 3D perovskite lattice and instead segregate to the film's surface and grain boundaries, forming a lower-dimensional (quasi-2D) capping layer that passivates surface dangling bonds and provides a hydrophobic barrier. The consequential impact of these combined passivation and crystallization control strategies is a significant improvement in device performance, primarily manifested as a reduction in the trap-state density (Nₜ), which suppresses non-radiative charge carrier recombination, leading to a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF).

The lead halide precursor, typically PbI₂, acts as a Lewis acid, forming intermediate adducts with the Lewis basic halide ions (I⁻) from the excess organic salts and polar aprotic solvents like DMF or DMSO. This complexation stabilizes PbI₂-containing colloids in the solution, significantly increasing the Gibbs free energy barrier for nucleation and thereby retarding the rapid, uncontrolled crystallization characteristic of stoichiometric precursor ratios.

Excess MAI primarily functions through a common ion effect, providing a surplus of iodide (I⁻) and methylammonium (MA⁺) ions that effectively fill iodide vacancies (Vᵢ⁻) and A-site cation vacancies (Vₘₐ), respectively, which are prevalent point defects. The MA⁺ cation, acting as a Lewis acid, and the I⁻ anion, a Lewis base, form adducts with undercoordinated lead (Pb²⁺) or halide ions at grain boundaries and surfaces, neutralizing deep-level trap states that cause non-radiative recombination. This surplus of organic cations also retards the crystallization kinetics, allowing for the formation of larger, more ordered crystalline grains with lower defect density. Similarly, LiI introduces excess I⁻ to passivate halide vacancies, while the small Li⁺ cation, due to its high charge density and small ionic radius, can occupy interstitial sites within the perovskite lattice or substitute A-site cations. This interstitial incorporation can favorably alter the lattice strain and electronic band structure, while Li⁺ also acts as a potent Lewis acid to passivate surface halide defects. Consequentially, these passivation strategies significantly suppress non-radiative charge carrier recombination, leading to a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF), thereby boosting the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, by immobilizing mobile ionic defects, particularly iodide vacancies, these additives enhance the operational and environmental stability of the perovskite solar cell by mitigating ion migration, which is a primary driver of material degradation and performance decay under illumination and thermal stress.",

Similarly, organic cations, such as guanidinium or phenethylammonium, can passivate both A-site and halide vacancies through hydrogen bonding or by forming low-dimensional perovskite capping layers that sterically hinder defect formation and prevent moisture ingress. Metal salts, particularly alkali halides like KCl or RbI, contribute by a dual mechanism: the alkali cations can occupy interstitial sites or substitute A-site cations to relieve lattice strain and suppress halide segregation in mixed-halide compositions, while the halide anions (e.g., I⁻, Cl⁻) directly fill halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺), which are among the most detrimental deep-level traps. The incorporation of excess halide ions, often through lead halide or methylammonium halide additives, increases the chemical potential of halides, thereby raising the formation energy of these vacancies and reducing their equilibrium concentration. This comprehensive passivation of electronic trap states significantly suppresses non-radiative recombination pathways, leading to an increase in charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, which consequently manifests as a substantial improvement in device performance, characterized by a higher open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀), an enhanced fill factor (FF), and a marked increase in both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term operational stability.",

Consequently, this combined effect of morphological control and defect passivation profoundly impacts device performance by suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways, which leads to a significant enhancement in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and charge carrier diffusion lengths, ultimately boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE), while also mitigating ion migration to improve operational stability and reduce current density-voltage hysteresis.",

    "reference_answer": "Organic amine - based precursor additives typically contain functional groups like amines that can coordinate with metal ions in perovskite precursors. They passivate defects by forming stable bonds with dangling bonds at defect sites, reducing non - radiative recombination. For crystallization, they can control the growth rate and orientation of perovskite crystals, leading to more uniform and well - ordered structures. This results in enhanced charge carrier mobility, improved device performance with higher PCE, and better stability as defects are minimized and crystal structures are optimized.",
    "model_output": "The principal chemical property of organic amine-based precursor additives is their Lewis basicity, originating from the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which enables them to function as coordinating ligands. During film formation, these amines coordinate with lead(II) halide precursors (e.g., PbI₂) to form intermediate adducts, which modulates the Gibbs free energy of crystallization, retarding the rapid reaction with the organic A-site cation (e.g., formamidinium iodide) and thereby controlling nucleation and growth to yield larger, more uniform crystalline grains with a lower density of grain boundaries. Post-crystallization, these additives specifically passivate defects by donating their electron lone pair to undercoordinated, Lewis-acidic lead ions (Pb²⁺) at surfaces and grain boundaries, thereby neutralizing deep-level trap states that act as non-radiative recombination centers. Furthermore, bulky organic cations, such as phenethylammonium (PEA⁺), are sterically hindered from incorporating into the 3D lattice and instead segregate to form low-dimensional (2D) perovskite capping layers at the film's surface and grain boundaries, where their protonated ammonium groups can also passivate halide vacancies via electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The consequential impact on device performance is a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), driven by the suppression of non-radiative recombination, which leads to increased carrier lifetimes, a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), and an improved fill factor (FF). Concurrently, these modifications drastically improve device stability; the hydrophobic organic chains of the 2D capping layers act as a barrier against moisture ingress, while the dense passivation layers at grain boundaries physically impede the migration of mobile ions (e.g., I⁻), mitigating current-voltage hysteresis and enhancing long-term operational durability.",

This complexation moderates the reaction kinetics between the lead halide and the organic cation salt, effectively slowing down the rapid and often uncontrolled nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase, thereby promoting a more favorable Ostwald ripening process that results in films with significantly larger grain sizes, reduced pinhole density, and improved morphology. The interaction with the material is twofold: the carboxylate moiety passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defect sites, which are prevalent at grain boundaries and on the film surface, thus reducing the density of trap states (Nt) that act as non-radiative recombination centers, while the long, hydrophobic alkyl chain of the oleic acid molecule tends to segregate at these grain boundaries.

For instance, iodide - based additives can compensate for iodine vacancies in perovskite structures, reducing non - radiative recombination losses and improving device performance.",
    "model_output": "Precursor additives influence perovskite crystallization and perform defect passivation primarily through Lewis acid-base chemistry and coordination interactions, which directly modulate the material's formation kinetics and electronic properties. The underlying mechanism for crystallization control involves the formation of a stable intermediate phase, where Lewis basic additives (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide) coordinate with the lead halide precursor (a Lewis acid, e.g., PbI₂), forming a chemical adduct that increases the Gibbs free energy of nucleation. This retards the rapid reaction with the organic halide salt, slowing down crystal formation and promoting the growth of larger, more uniform, and highly oriented crystalline grains while reducing the density of grain boundaries. The specific interaction for defect passivation occurs as these or other functional molecules bind to electronic trap states, which are predominantly located at grain boundaries and film surfaces. For instance, molecules containing lone-pair-donating atoms (O, N, S) form coordinative bonds with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, passivating cationic defects, while halide anions from additive salts can fill halide vacancies (Vₓ) and bulky organic cations can passivate both cationic and anionic surface defects through ionic and hydrogen bonding. The consequential impact on device performance is a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability; improved crystallinity and larger grains enhance charge transport, boosting short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀) and fill factor (FF), while the passivation of trap states suppresses non-radiative charge recombination, leading to a substantial increase in open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and carrier lifetime, and concurrently mitigating ion migration to improve operational stability and reduce J-V hysteresis.",

    "model_output": "Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) exhibit distinct chemical natures and passivation mechanisms rooted in the properties of their respective organic cations, which profoundly influence perovskite solar cell performance. The underlying difference lies in the larger ionic radius and higher molecular symmetry of the formamidinium (FA+) cation compared to the methylammonium (MA+) cation, rendering FAI less volatile and more thermally robust due to stronger N-H···I hydrogen bonding. In terms of material interaction, both additives supply excess iodide ions (I-) that effectively passivate positively charged iodide vacancies (V_I+), a primary source of non-radiative recombination; however, the FA+ cation uniquely stabilizes the photoactive α-phase perovskite lattice by better satisfying the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, thereby reducing lattice strain and suppressing the formation of detrimental defects. Furthermore, FA+ more effectively passivates under-coordinated lead (Pb2+) ions and residual lead iodide (PbI2) at grain boundaries, whereas the higher volatility and dynamic rotational freedom of the MA+ cation can introduce structural instabilities and initiate degradation pathways. Consequently, the superior defect passivation and structural stabilization provided by FAI lead to devices with higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE), stemming from a narrower optical bandgap and longer charge carrier lifetimes, and critically, confer significantly enhanced thermal and operational stability compared to their MAI-containing counterparts, which are more susceptible to rapid degradation under thermal and environmental stress.",

    "reference_answer": "Formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) additives in perovskite solar cells play crucial roles. FA helps in forming a stable perovskite structure, influencing crystal growth orientation and improving charge transport properties. Cs can passivate defects within the perovskite lattice, reducing non - radiative recombination losses. These additives enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by improving charge extraction and reducing charge recombination rates, and also contribute to better device stability.",
    "model_output": "The incorporation of formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) as A-site cations is a critical compositional engineering strategy to enhance the optoelectronic properties and stability of metal-halide perovskite absorbers. The underlying physical mechanism is the optimization of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t), which dictates the stability of the perovskite crystal structure. The larger organic FA cation (CH(NH₂)₂⁺) is introduced to form perovskites like FAPbI₃, which possess a near-optimal bandgap (~1.48 eV) for single-junction photovoltaics, but its pure form is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature, tending to transition from the desired photoactive black α-phase to the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase. The specific interaction of incorporating the smaller, inorganic Cs⁺ cation into the FA-based lattice induces a contraction of the crystal lattice, which increases the tolerance factor towards the ideal range (0.8 < t < 1.0), thereby stabilizing the α-phase and suppressing this detrimental phase transition. This synergistic interaction not only reduces internal lattice strain but also passivates defect states, such as halide vacancies, and suppresses ion migration and halide segregation in mixed-halide compositions. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted: the FA-induced narrow bandgap maximizes the short-circuit current density (Jsc) by extending light absorption into the near-infrared, while the Cs-imparted structural stabilization and defect passivation reduce non-radiative recombination pathways, leading to a significant increase in both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Ultimately, this dual-cation approach yields perovskite solar cells with concurrently high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and substantially improved long-term operational and thermal stability.",

The inorganic alkali metal halides, CsI and RbI, function primarily through a physical mechanism of lattice engineering, where the small ionic radii of Cs⁺ and Rb⁺ allow for their partial substitution at the A-site cation position, particularly in formamidinium (FA)-based systems. This incorporation tunes the Goldschmidt tolerance factor closer to the ideal range for a stable cubic perovskite structure, thereby suppressing the thermally-induced phase transition to the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase and mitigating lattice strain. The consequential structural stabilization and improved crystallographic quality, often characterized by larger grain sizes and reduced grain boundary density, lead to a decrease in non-radiative recombination pathways, which enhances carrier lifetimes, open-circuit voltage (V_oc), and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE), while critically improving the long-term thermal and operational stability of the device. In contrast, choline iodide, a larger organic ammonium salt, acts predominantly through a chemical passivation mechanism due to steric hindrance preventing its incorporation into the bulk lattice. Instead, the choline cation segregates to the perovskite film's surfaces and grain boundaries, where its hydroxyl (-OH) functional group and quaternary ammonium head effectively passivate defects; the choline cation neutralizes negatively charged defects like lead vacancies (V_Pb²⁻), while the hydroxyl group can form Lewis acid-base adducts with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions or hydrogen bonds with the lattice, thereby passivating trap states. This targeted surface and grain boundary passivation significantly reduces trap-state density, which directly suppresses non-radiative recombination, leading to a substantial increase in V_oc and fill factor, and consequently, a marked improvement in both PCE and environmental stability by inhibiting defect-mediated degradation pathways.",

    "reference_answer": "Cs iodide in perovskite precursors can influence crystallization by providing Cs cations. It can assist in forming a more stable perovskite structure. A proper amount of Cs iodide can lead to better - ordered crystal growth, improved film quality, reduced trap states, and enhanced charge extraction, which can enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells by optimizing the charge transfer at the perovskite - electron acceptor interface.",
    "model_output": "The incorporation of cesium iodide (CsI) as an additive into perovskite precursors fundamentally alters the crystallization pathway by modulating both the nucleation and growth kinetics, which is driven by its influence on the Gibbs free energy of formation for the perovskite phase. The underlying physical mechanism involves the partial substitution of larger organic cations (e.g., formamidinium, FA⁺) with the smaller inorganic Cs⁺ cation at the A-site, which induces a tolerable lattice strain and contraction. This structural modification increases the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, thereby thermodynamically stabilizing the desired photoactive black α-phase and suppressing the deleterious phase transition to the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase, particularly in formamidinium-rich compositions. This controlled crystallization results in a more uniform film morphology characterized by larger, more compact grains with a lower density of grain boundaries, while the Cs⁺ incorporation concurrently passivates intrinsic point defects, such as A-site and halide vacancies, mitigating non-radiative recombination pathways. Consequently, the impact on device performance is a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), primarily through an increased open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF) due to suppressed charge carrier recombination and improved charge transport, coupled with a marked improvement in the long-term operational and thermal stability of the resulting perovskite solar cells.",

The underlying mechanism involves direct chemical interactions where additives, such as alkali metal halides (e.g., KCl, RbI) or excess lead halides (e.g., PbI₂), engage with the perovskite precursor solution and solid-state lattice. Chemically, anions like Cl⁻ or I⁻ function as Lewis bases, donating electron pairs to passivate undercoordinated Pb²⁺ cations (Lewis acid sites), which are prominent deep-level trap states, particularly at grain boundaries and surfaces. Concurrently, small inorganic cations like K⁺ or Cs⁺ can occupy A-site vacancies or interstitial positions, relieving lattice strain and increasing the formation energy of detrimental defects like halide vacancies (Vₓ). This dual-passivation strategy profoundly influences film formation by modulating the crystallization kinetics; additives can form intermediate complexes that retard the rapid, uncontrolled growth of the perovskite phase, leading to higher-quality films with larger, more oriented grains and reduced pinhole density. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted: the significant reduction in trap-assisted non-radiative recombination elevates the quasi-Fermi level splitting, leading to a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀). Furthermore, the improved film morphology and longer carrier diffusion lengths enhance charge extraction efficiency, boosting the short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀) and fill factor (FF), which collectively elevates the power conversion efficiency (PCE).

This complexation retards the otherwise rapid and uncontrolled reaction between the organic A-site cation and the lead-halide framework, effectively lowering the Gibbs free energy of nucleation and promoting a higher density of nucleation sites for more uniform crystal growth. The resulting slower crystallization kinetics facilitate the formation of a high-quality perovskite film characterized by significantly larger, more uniform grains, a lower density of grain boundaries, and superior crystallinity.

By anchoring to these specific sites, the additive molecules act as capping agents or surfactants, passivating surface trap states and sterically hindering the addition of precursor ions onto these facets, thereby kinetically controlling the growth rate in a direction-dependent manner. This selective adsorption results in anisotropic crystal growth, promoting the formation of larger, highly oriented grains (e.g., with (100) facets parallel to the substrate) and reducing the density of grain boundaries, which consequently enhances device performance by suppressing non-radiative charge recombination, improving charge carrier transport, and boosting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), while simultaneously improving the material's intrinsic stability against environmental stressors like moisture due to the passivation of reactive surface defects.",

They act as solvents for perovskite precursors, aiding in the dissolution of lead halide and organic cation components. Their mechanism involves forming hydrogen bonds with the precursor molecules, which helps in the homogeneous mixing of the solution. This leads to better crystallization control, as the solvents can influence the growth rate and orientation of perovskite crystals. For MAI, it is an organic cation source. It reacts with lead halide precursors to form perovskite structures. Its mechanism is based on ionic bonding, where it provides the organic cation framework within the perovskite lattice. This affects the overall structure and properties of the perovskite, influencing charge transport and stability. Overall, these additives can improve the solubility of precursors, enhance the crystallization process, passivate defects, and increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells by modifying the chemical environment during perovskite formation.",
    "model_output": "Additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), and excess methylammonium iodide (MAI) critically influence perovskite film formation and quality through distinct chemical and physical mechanisms. DMSO and DMF, both polar aprotic solvents, function as Lewis bases that interact with the Lewis acidic lead(II) iodide (PbI₂) precursor. DMSO, being a stronger Lewis base due to its sulfoxide group, forms a stable intermediate crystalline adduct (e.g., PbI₂·DMSO) by coordinating with the Pb²⁺ ions, which effectively retards the rapid, uncontrolled crystallization upon introduction of the MAI precursor. This controlled crystallization pathway, often termed solvent engineering, facilitates the growth of larger, more uniform perovskite grains with a lower density of grain boundaries and pinholes, thereby reducing non-radiative recombination sites and significantly enhancing Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) and device reproducibility. DMF, while a primary solvent, is a weaker Lewis base and forms less stable adducts, leading to faster crystallization kinetics when used alone. In contrast, the use of excess MAI acts not as a crystallization retardant but as a defect passivator through compositional engineering. The surplus of MA⁺ and I⁻ ions interacts directly with the perovskite lattice and its surfaces to passivate intrinsic point defects; specifically, excess iodide ions fill iodide vacancies (V_I⁺), and excess methylammonium cations can passivate negatively charged defects such as lead vacancies (V_Pb²⁻) or lead-iodide antisites (Pb_I⁻).

Furthermore, large-chain organic ammonium halides, such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), function by forming a low-dimensional (2D) perovskite capping layer on top of the 3D bulk film, which effectively passivates surface dangling bonds and creates a hydrophobic, wide-bandgap barrier. The consequential impact of these passivation strategies on device performance is profound: by suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways, they significantly increase charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, leading to a substantial enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) primarily through an increase in the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF).

    "model_output": "The distinct roles of formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) as precursor additives stem fundamentally from the differing steric and electronic properties of the FA+ and MA+ cations. When used as an additive, FAI primarily functions as a crystallization modulator and structural stabilizer; the larger ionic radius of the FA+ cation pushes the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the resulting mixed-cation perovskite lattice closer to the ideal value of unity, promoting the formation of the photoactive, cubic α-phase and suppressing the undesirable, non-perovskite δ-phase. This modulation slows crystallization kinetics, leading to superior film morphology characterized by larger grain sizes and lower grain boundary density, which in turn reduces charge carrier scattering and recombination. In contrast, excess MAI predominantly acts as a defect passivator through a mass-action effect, where the increased concentration of MA+ and I- ions in the precursor solution effectively suppresses the formation of detrimental methylammonium vacancies (V_MA-) and iodide vacancies (V_I+), which are primary sources of non-radiative recombination. While both additives provide excess iodide to passivate V_I+ defects, the consequential impact on device performance differs: FAI's structural benefits yield a substantial increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) through improvements in all photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) and enhanced intrinsic thermal and phase stability.

Following crystallization, the excess halide anions (e.g., Cl⁻, I⁻) function as Lewis bases to coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions, which are prominent Lewis acid defect sites at grain boundaries and on the film surface, and simultaneously fill positively charged halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺). This direct interaction with the material effectively passivates deep-level electronic trap states within the bandgap that would otherwise act as centers for non-radiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. The consequential impact on device performance is a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), primarily driven by a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) due to the suppression of non-radiative recombination pathways and a corresponding increase in the quasi-Fermi level splitting. Furthermore, the reduced trap density improves charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and, to a lesser extent, an increased short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀), while the stabilization of the lattice by passivating mobile ionic defects also critically enhances the operational and long-term stability of the device.",

These functional groups form coordinate bonds with undercoordinated, Lewis acidic metal cations, predominantly Pb²⁺ or Sn²⁺, which are prevalent at crystal surfaces and grain boundaries. This specific interaction effectively satisfies the coordination sphere of the metal cation, thereby electronically deactivating deep-level trap states associated with point defects like halide vacancies (Vₓ⁻) and antisite defects (e.g., Pbᵢ). Concurrently, cationic moieties, such as the ammonium group in alkylammonium halides, can passivate negatively charged defects through electrostatic screening and stabilize the lattice via hydrogen bonding with adjacent halide ions.

Lewis base additives, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), urea, or thiourea, possess lone electron pairs that coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions (a Lewis acid) in the precursor solution, forming intermediate adducts like PbI₂-DMSO. This interaction effectively retards the rapid crystallization kinetics of the perovskite, allowing for a more controlled growth process that results in larger, more oriented crystal grains with a lower density of grain boundaries and passivated surface defects, which consequently suppresses non-radiative recombination pathways, leading to an enhanced open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). In another approach, ionic additives like alkali metal halides (e.g., KCl, RbI) or excess organic ammonium halides (e.g., MACl) directly interact with the perovskite lattice; smaller alkali cations can occupy A-site vacancies or induce compressive lattice strain, modifying the Goldschmidt tolerance factor to stabilize the desired photoactive phase (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) against thermal or environmental degradation. Chloride ions from additives like MACl can act as a template, forming an intermediate phase that lowers the activation energy for crystallization and is subsequently expelled during annealing, promoting superior film morphology. These ionic interactions directly passivate charged point defects (e.g., halide vacancies) and immobilize ion migration, which not only boosts device stability but also significantly reduces current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis.

The underlying mechanism for halide-based additives, such as excess PbCl₂ or hydrohalic acids, involves modulating the crystallization kinetics by forming intermediate coordination complexes or transient mixed-halide phases (e.g., MAPbI₃₋ₓClₓ) in the precursor solution, which retards the rapid precipitation of the perovskite film, thereby promoting the growth of larger, more oriented crystal grains with a lower density of grain boundaries. In terms of material interaction, these inorganic species directly address intrinsic lattice defects; excess halide anions effectively passivate positively charged halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺) and undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites, which act as deep-level traps for non-radiative recombination, while alkali metal cations can be directly incorporated into the A-site of the ABX₃ lattice. This A-site substitution modifies the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, structurally stabilizing the desired photoactive perovskite phase (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) against degradation and suppressing halide segregation in mixed-halide compositions. Consequently, these interactions yield substantial improvements in device performance, manifesting as a significant reduction in non-radiative recombination losses, which elevates the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF). Furthermore, the enhanced crystallographic quality and intrinsic lattice stabilization directly translate to superior operational and environmental stability by mitigating ion migration, suppressing current-voltage hysteresis, and increasing the device's resilience to thermal and atmospheric stressors.",

    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts such as formamidinium (FA⁺) and methylammonium (MA⁺), typically introduced as halide salts (e.g., FAI, MABr), passivate defects in metal-halide perovskites primarily through a combination of Lewis acid-base interactions and ionic compensation at surfaces, grain boundaries, and within the bulk lattice. The primary interaction involves the halide anion (e.g., I⁻, Br⁻) from the salt acting as a Lewis base, which donates an electron pair to coordinate with undercoordinated lead (Pb²⁺) ions—prevalent Lewis acid sites that act as deep-level electronic traps—thereby forming a stable adduct and satisfying the coordination shell of the lead center. Concurrently, the organic cations (FA⁺/MA⁺) and their associated halide anions can fill native point defects, such as A-site cation vacancies (V_A⁻) and halide vacancies (V_X⁺) respectively, which reduces the density of charge trapping centers and suppresses ion migration pathways. The consequential impact on device performance is profound: the passivation of these trap states significantly suppresses non-radiative charge carrier recombination, which increases the quasi-Fermi level splitting and leads to a substantial enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (V_oc).

    "model_output": "The chemical nature, mechanism, and impact of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), formamidinium iodide (FAI), and methylammonium iodide (MAI) as additives in perovskite precursors are fundamentally distinct, stemming from their respective roles as a non-structural dopant versus structural lattice components. LiTFSI is an ionic salt that does not incorporate into the perovskite lattice but functions primarily as a p-dopant and surface passivator; its large TFSI⁻ anion acts as a Lewis base, passivating undercoordinated Pb²⁺ Lewis acid defect sites at grain boundaries and interfaces, which suppresses non-radiative recombination and improves charge extraction, thereby enhancing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the hygroscopic nature of the Li⁺ cation severely compromises long-term device stability by accelerating moisture-induced degradation. In contrast, FAI and MAI are organic halide salts that serve as primary A-site cation precursors, directly incorporating into the ABX₃ crystal structure. The principal difference between them lies in the cation's size and properties: the larger formamidinium (FA⁺) cation is ideal for forming perovskites with a narrower, more favorable optical bandgap (~1.47 eV) for higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), and it imparts greater thermal stability due to stronger hydrogen bonding within the lattice, though pure FAPbI₃ suffers from a deleterious phase transition from the photoactive α-phase to the non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature. The smaller methylammonium (MA⁺) cation forms the archetypal MAPbI₃ with a wider bandgap (~1.55 eV) and is structurally stable at room temperature but exhibits poor thermal stability due to the volatility of MAI, which leads to lattice decomposition. When used in stoichiometric excess, both FAI and MAI also serve a defect passivation role by supplying iodide ions to fill halide vacancies (V_I⁺), a critical mechanism for reducing trap-state density and improving overall device performance and stability.",

This interaction effectively neutralizes deep-level charge traps, suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways, which manifests as an increased photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), a higher open-circuit voltage (V_oc), and an improved fill factor (FF), ultimately boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE). Another class involves ionic liquids, such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM-BF₄), which provide a multifaceted passivation effect; their constituent cations and anions can simultaneously interact with and passivate both anionic (halide vacancies) and cationic (A-site or Pb²⁺) defects through electrostatic interactions and coordinative bonding, while their preferential segregation to grain boundaries forms a robust barrier against ion migration and moisture ingress, leading to a significant enhancement in both PCE and long-term operational stability. Furthermore, macromolecular additives like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) offer a dual passivation strategy, where functional groups (e.g., carbonyls) coordinate with surface Pb²⁺ defects while the long polymer chains physically encapsulate the perovskite grains, a mechanism that both reduces surface recombination and creates a physical barrier, thereby improving device stability against environmental stressors like humidity and heat.",

Beyond this primary stoichiometric function, a controlled excess of iodide ions functions as a critical defect passivation agent, primarily by shifting the defect formation equilibrium according to Le Châtelier's principle to suppress the creation of iodide vacancies (Vᵢ⁻), which are deep-level charge traps predominantly located at grain boundaries and surfaces. This interaction passivates existing Vᵢ⁻ sites and increases their formation energy, thereby mitigating non-radiative recombination pathways and favorably modifying the electronic structure, as the valence band maximum is principally composed of I 5p orbitals. Consequently, this defect passivation directly enhances device performance by increasing charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, which manifests as a significant reduction in the open-circuit voltage (Vₒc) deficit and improvements in the fill factor (FF), culminating in a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE).

Their function is multifaceted, primarily revolving around defect passivation and crystallization control. The underlying mechanism involves coordinative interactions and Lewis acid-base chemistry, where the functional groups of the organic cation (e.g., -NH3+) form hydrogen bonds with undercoordinated lattice halides, while the additive's halide anion fills halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺), effectively neutralizing charged trap states at grain boundaries and surfaces. This passivation of defects, such as uncoordinated Pb²⁺ ions and halide vacancies, significantly reduces non-radiative recombination pathways. Furthermore, certain additives, particularly smaller ones like methylammonium chloride (MACl), act as crystallization modulators by forming transient intermediate phases with lead halides, which alters the Gibbs free energy of formation and slows down the perovskite crystallization kinetics, promoting the growth of larger, more oriented grains with lower defect density and improved film morphology. In contrast, bulky organic cations, which are sterically hindered from incorporating into the 3D lattice due to tolerance factor constraints, segregate to the film's surface and grain boundaries to form low-dimensional (2D or quasi-2D) Ruddlesden-Popper or Dion-Jacobson phases.

MAI, containing the small and volatile organic MA⁺ cation, facilitates rapid crystallization but results in films with lower thermal stability and a propensity for forming defects like iodide and methylammonium vacancies, which act as non-radiative recombination centers and pathways for moisture-induced degradation. In contrast, the larger FAI precursor forms FAPbI₃, which possesses a more ideal tolerance factor, a narrower bandgap beneficial for higher power conversion efficiency (PCE), and superior intrinsic thermal stability; however, its photoactive black α-phase is thermodynamically metastable at ambient conditions, readily converting to the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase, which severely compromises device performance and longevity. The inorganic CsI, with the smallest Cs⁺ cation, yields a tolerance factor well below the stable range, causing the α-CsPbI₃ phase to be extremely unstable. Consequently, the most effective strategy involves A-site cation engineering, where a combination of these precursors, typically in an FAI-dominant formulation with minor additions of CsI and/or MAI, is used to synergistically stabilize the crystal structure. This alloying modulates lattice strain, entropically stabilizes the desired α-phase by increasing the activation energy for the α-to-δ phase transition, and passivates vacancy-type defects, leading to the formation of high-quality crystalline films with larger grains, reduced non-radiative recombination, and significantly enhanced operational and thermal stability, ultimately enabling higher PCEs in final devices.",

The underlying mechanism involves the amine's nitrogen lone pair acting as a Lewis base, which donates electron density to coordinate with undercoordinated lead ions (Pb²⁺), potent Lewis acids prevalent at lead vacancies (Vₚₑ) and on crystal surfaces and grain boundaries. Simultaneously, the protonated ammonium cation (R-NH₃⁺) of the additive can form strong hydrogen bonds with halide anions, effectively neutralizing halide vacancies (Vₓ) and electrostatically interacting with negatively charged defects like interstitial halides (Xᵢ⁻). For larger, bulkier organic amines such as phenethylammonium, this interaction extends to the formation of a 2D perovskite capping layer atop the 3D bulk perovskite, creating a 2D/3D heterostructure that passivates surface-level dangling bonds. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted: the suppression of these deep-level trap states drastically reduces non-radiative recombination, leading to a significant increase in charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length. This directly translates to a higher open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF), boosting the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, the immobilization of mobile ions through these bonding interactions and the steric hindrance offered by the organic moieties effectively mitigate ion migration, which in turn suppresses I-V curve hysteresis and enhances the operational stability of the device, while the hydrophobic nature of the organic component often imparts improved resistance to moisture-induced degradation.",

The underlying mechanism for crystallization control involves the formation of Lewis acid-base adducts in the precursor solution, where the excess iodide anions (I⁻) coordinate with Lewis acidic lead cations (Pb²⁺) to form intermediate polyiodide plumbate complexes like [PbI₃]⁻ or [PbI₄]²⁻. This complexation retards the rapid, uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite phase, promoting a more favorable nucleation and growth process that results in larger, more uniform crystalline grains with fewer grain boundaries and a reduced density of pinholes, while also stabilizing the desired photoactive black phase (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) against transformation into inactive polymorphs. Concurrently, these additives interact directly with the perovskite lattice to passivate defects; the surplus of I⁻ ions effectively fills iodide vacancies (Vᵢ⁺), which are prevalent shallow trap states, via the mass-action effect, while also neutralizing undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defect sites at grain boundaries and surfaces. Additives with bulky organic cations (e.g., PEA⁺) further induce the in-situ formation of a thin, wide-bandgap 2D perovskite layer atop the 3D bulk film, creating a 2D/3D heterostructure that passivates surface states and acts as a hydrophobic barrier. The consequential impact on device performance is a significant reduction in non-radiative recombination, leading to a substantial increase in open-circuit voltage (Vₒc) and fill factor (FF), while the improved film morphology enhances charge transport and boosts the short-circuit current density (Jₛc).

The consequential impact of this chemical passivation is a significant suppression of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, leading to a marked increase in charge carrier lifetime, which directly translates to higher open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) and fill factor (FF), thereby elevating the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).

    "model_output": "The primary function of organic ligands as additives in perovskite precursors is rooted in their ability to act as Lewis bases, modulating both the crystallization kinetics and the electronic properties of the final film through coordination chemistry. These ligands, possessing electron-donating functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amino (-NH₂), or sulfoxide (S=O), form intermediate adducts by coordinating with the Lewis acidic lead(II) cations (Pb²⁺) in the precursor solution. This interaction retards the rapid, uncontrolled crystallization of the perovskite phase, promoting the formation of a high-quality film with larger, more oriented crystal grains and a lower density of grain boundaries. Critically, this coordination persists in the solid state, where the ligands passivate charge-trapping defects, particularly undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions and halide vacancies, which are prevalent at grain boundaries and surfaces. By satisfying the coordination shell of these metallic centers, the ligands effectively eliminate mid-gap electronic states that act as non-radiative recombination centers. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted and significant: the suppression of non-radiative recombination leads to an increase in charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF), thereby boosting the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).

The core interaction involves the oxidation of metallic lead (Pb⁰) clusters, which are deep-level trap states predominantly located at grain boundaries and surfaces of the perovskite film, formed due to halide loss or reductive decomposition. The iodine additive reacts with these Pb⁰ defects to form lead iodide (PbI₂), a more chemically stable and electronically benign wide-bandgap material, effectively healing the trap site via the reaction Pb⁰ + I₂ → PbI₂. This process also elevates the iodine chemical potential within the precursor solution and the crystallizing film, which, according to thermodynamic principles, suppresses the formation of iodide vacancies (V_I⁺), another prevalent point defect that contributes to non-radiative recombination.

This direct chemical equilibrium shift specifically targets and reduces the concentration of these intrinsic point defects within the perovskite lattice, thereby passivating the bulk material.

    "model_output": "The fundamental distinction between organic and inorganic anionic precursor additives in perovskite solar cells lies in their chemical nature and consequent mechanisms of action, which dictate their interaction with the perovskite lattice and its defects. Organic anions, such as acetate (CH₃COO⁻) or formate (HCOO⁻), are typically larger, bulkier molecules that function primarily as Lewis bases, coordinating with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions at grain boundaries and surfaces. This coordination passivates cationic defects, such as lead vacancies (V_Pb²⁻) and antisite defects (Pb_I), thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways and enhancing the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF). Furthermore, these organic additives can form intermediate complexes with lead halides (e.g., Pb(OAc)₂), which modulates the Gibbs free energy of perovskite formation, slowing down the crystallization kinetics and promoting the growth of larger, more oriented grains with lower defect density. In contrast, inorganic anions, predominantly small halides like chloride (Cl⁻) or bromide (Br⁻), interact with the perovskite more intimately through direct incorporation into the halide sublattice. Their primary mechanism involves filling anionic vacancies (V_X⁺), which are deep-level traps that severely limit charge carrier lifetimes. The incorporation of chloride, for instance, is well-known to improve material quality by enhancing the solubility of lead iodide in the precursor solution, which facilitates a more uniform and slower crystallization process, leading to superior film morphology and longer charge carrier diffusion lengths. While organic anions act largely as external crystallization modulators and surface passivating agents that can be volatile or leave residues, inorganic anions become integral lattice components, directly healing bulk defects and enhancing the intrinsic structural and electronic stability of the perovskite film, ultimately leading to devices with both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and improved operational longevity.",

    "reference_answer": "Precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells by coordinating with metal cations to reduce cation vacancies, reacting with halide anions to eliminate halide vacancies or interstitials, and forming surface coatings to block non-radiative recombination centers.",
    "model_output": "Precursor additives primarily passivate defects in perovskite films through coordinative bonding, predominantly via Lewis acid-base interactions, and through ionic compensation. The underlying mechanism involves electron-donating functional groups present on the additive molecule, such as carbonyl (C=O), sulfoxide (S=O), or amine (-NH₂) groups, which act as Lewis bases, donating lone pair electrons to undercoordinated lead cations (Pb²⁺), which are prominent Lewis acidic defect sites located at grain boundaries and on the film surface. This interaction effectively neutralizes deep-level charge trap states associated with these defects. Concurrently, other additives, such as halide salts (e.g., KCl) or large organic ammonium halides (e.g., phenethylammonium iodide), can fill anionic point defects like halide vacancies (V_I⁺) through ionic bonding, thereby passivating positively charged trap states and suppressing their formation energy. The consequential impact of this defect passivation is a significant reduction in non-radiative Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which prolongs charge carrier lifetimes and increases diffusion lengths. This directly translates to improved device performance, manifesting as a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF), ultimately boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, by healing defect sites that act as initiation points for degradation, such as by immobilizing mobile ions and fortifying grain boundaries against moisture ingress, these additives critically enhance the operational and environmental stability of the perovskite solar cell against humidity, thermal stress, and continuous illumination.",

    "question": "How do metal halide salts function as precursor additives in perovskite solar cells, and what is their impact on defect passivation and device performance?",
    "reference_answer": "Metal halide salts provide the halide ions necessary for perovskite formation. They react with metal cations to form the perovskite crystal structure. In terms of defect passivation, they can potentially fill vacancies and reduce non-radiative recombination centers. This leads to improved device performance with enhanced power conversion efficiency and better stability as charge carrier trapping and recombination losses are reduced.",
    "model_output": "Metal halide salts, when incorporated as additives into perovskite precursor solutions, primarily function by modulating the crystallization kinetics and thermodynamics of the perovskite film formation through mechanisms such as the common ion effect and intermediate phase templating. The introduction of excess halide ions (e.g., from KCl or PbI₂) increases the chemical potential of the halide species, which thermodynamically suppresses the formation of performance-limiting halide vacancies (Vₓ⁺) and passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ Lewis acid sites at grain boundaries and surfaces. This controlled crystallization process typically results in perovskite films with significantly larger, more uniform grains and a lower density of grain boundaries, which act as sites for non-radiative recombination. Consequently, the effective passivation of these electronic trap states and the improved film morphology have a profound impact on device performance: the suppression of non-radiative recombination pathways reduces the open-circuit voltage (Vₒ꜀) deficit, while the enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect density prolong carrier diffusion lengths, thereby increasing the short-circuit current density (Jₛ꜀) and fill factor (FF), ultimately leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, the stabilization of the perovskite lattice and the passivation of mobile ionic defects mitigate ion migration under operational stress, which is a key factor in reducing current-voltage hysteresis and enhancing the long-term operational and environmental stability of the resulting solar cell.",

    "model_output": "Organic ammonium salts, such as formamidinium (FA+) and methylammonium (MA+), passivate defects in metal-halide perovskites primarily through a combination of stoichiometric compensation and Lewis acid-base interactions at crystal surfaces and grain boundaries. The underlying mechanism involves the introduction of excess organic cations and their corresponding halides (e.g., from FAI or MAI) during synthesis, which effectively fills A-site cation and halide vacancies (V_A⁺ and V_X⁻), thereby satisfying the lattice's stoichiometric requirements and reducing the concentration of deep-level trap states. Specifically, the ammonium functional group (-NH3+) of the organic cation acts as a Lewis base, donating its electron lone pair to coordinate with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions (Lewis acid sites), which are prevalent at surfaces and grain boundaries and are a major source of non-radiative recombination. This interaction electronically passivates these trap states, effectively increasing the activation energy for non-radiative charge carrier recombination pathways, such as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. The consequential impact on device performance is multifaceted and significant: the suppression of trap-assisted recombination leads to longer charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, which elevates the quasi-Fermi level splitting and results in a substantial increase in the open-circuit voltage (V_oc), a primary determinant of overall efficiency. Furthermore, by healing ionic defects like halide vacancies, this passivation strategy mitigates ion migration under operational bias, which enhances device stability, reduces current-voltage hysteresis, and ultimately enables the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and improved long-term operational robustness.",

    "question": "What are the two main ways precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells and how do these actions affect power conversion efficiency (PCE)?",
    "reference_answer": "Precursor additives passivate defects by interacting with defect sites, filling vacancies, or coordinating with defect-related atoms. This reduces non-radiative recombination losses, leading to an increase in PCE due to improved charge extraction and carrier mobility.",
    "model_output": "The two principal mechanisms by which precursor additives passivate defects in perovskite solar cells are Lewis acid-base adduct formation and ionic compensation, both of which substantially elevate power conversion efficiency (PCE). The first mechanism, chemical passivation, involves the introduction of Lewis base molecules containing electron-donating atoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur) into the precursor solution; these molecules form coordinate bonds with undercoordinated, Lewis-acidic lead (Pb²⁺) ions prevalent at grain boundaries and surfaces, thereby neutralizing the deep-level electronic trap states associated with these sites. The second mechanism, ionic passivation, relies on the incorporation of specific ions to compensate for or fill intrinsic point defects within the perovskite lattice. For instance, alkali metal cations (e.g., K⁺, Rb⁺) can occupy interstitial sites or A-site vacancies, altering defect formation energies and reducing lattice strain, while excess halide anions (e.g., I⁻, Cl⁻) directly fill halide vacancies. The consequential impact of these passivation strategies on device performance is profound: by significantly reducing the density of trap states, they suppress non-radiative charge carrier recombination, which is the dominant voltage-loss pathway. This suppression directly increases the quasi-Fermi level splitting under illumination, leading to a marked enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and secondarily improves charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, contributing to modest gains in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), ultimately culminating in a higher overall PCE and often improved operational stability.",

Their iodide anions participate in the halide ion exchange process during perovskite formation, influencing the stoichiometry and quality of the perovskite film.",
    "model_output": "The incorporation of excess formamidinium iodide (FAI) or methylammonium iodide (MAI) during perovskite film formation serves as a critical strategy to modulate crystallization kinetics and control stoichiometry, fundamentally operating on the principle of chemical equilibrium to suppress decomposition. The supplemental iodide anions (I⁻) effectively passivate prevalent halide vacancies (V_I⁺), which act as deep-level trap states and mediators for ion migration, thereby reducing non-radiative recombination pathways. Concurrently, the volatile organic cations (FA⁺ or MA⁺) compensate for their own sublimation loss during thermal annealing, preventing the formation of A-site vacancies and the subsequent degradation into lead iodide (PbI₂), thus preserving the requisite ABX₃ stoichiometry. In FA-dominant systems, the inclusion of MAI is particularly crucial for its interaction with the crystal lattice, where it stabilizes the photoactive black α-phase (α-FAPbI₃) and inhibits its detrimental transformation into the photo-inactive yellow δ-phase. Furthermore, the excess salt can act as a liquid-phase or vapor-phase flux during annealing, promoting mass transport that facilitates Ostwald ripening and recrystallization, resulting in films with significantly larger grain sizes, higher crystallinity, and reduced grain boundary density. This synergistic passivation of defects and enhancement of film morphology directly translates to superior device performance, manifesting as an increased open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and fill factor (FF) due to suppressed recombination, and an improved short-circuit current density (J_sc) from enhanced charge carrier transport, culminating in substantially higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and improved operational stability.",

Organic additives, typically Lewis bases such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), thiourea, or pyridine, function by forming intermediate adducts with lead halide precursors (e.g., PbI₂). This Lewis acid-base interaction temporarily retards the rapid perovskite crystallization, promoting the formation of larger, more uniform grains with fewer pinholes and reduced grain boundary density. Other organic molecules, including polymers like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or zwitterions, can passivate surface defects, particularly uncoordinated Pb²⁺ ions and halide vacancies, which act as non-radiative recombination centers, thereby leading to a significant reduction in charge carrier recombination, an enhanced open-circuit voltage (V_oc), and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). Conversely, inorganic additives, such as alkali metal halides (e.g., KCl, RbI) or pseudo-halides (e.g., Pb(SCN)₂), primarily influence the perovskite's structural and electronic properties. These ions can be incorporated into the lattice, either substitutionally at the A-site (e.g., K⁺ for FA⁺) or B-site (e.g., Sr²⁺ for Pb²⁺), or interstitially, inducing controlled lattice strain which can modify the Goldschmidt tolerance factor to stabilize the desired photoactive perovskite phase (e.g., α-FAPbI₃) and suppress halide vacancy formation.

This process effectively retards the rapid, kinetically-driven precipitation of the perovskite phase, enabling a more thermodynamically favorable growth regime that results in higher-quality films.

    "model_output": "Organic cation-based and metal-organic framework (MOF)-based precursor additives enhance perovskite solar cell performance and stability through distinct yet complementary mechanisms rooted in defect passivation and crystallization control. Organic cation additives, typically large-radius alkyl- or aryl-ammonium halides like phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), function primarily via Lewis acid-base chemistry, where the amine functional group (Lewis base) coordinates with undercoordinated Pb²⁺ ions (Lewis acid) at perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. This interaction passivates deep-level trap states, thereby suppressing non-radiative recombination pathways, which directly translates to an increased open-circuit voltage (V_oc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, the steric hindrance of these bulky cations can induce the formation of a low-dimensional (2D/quasi-2D) perovskite capping layer, which acts as a hydrophobic barrier against moisture ingress and inhibits ion migration, thus improving long-term environmental and operational stability. In contrast, MOF-based additives, such as ZIF-8 or UiO-66, leverage their unique porous structure and chemical composition, acting as either sacrificial templates or functional fillers. As sacrificial agents, they can slowly release their constituent organic linkers and metal ions, which subsequently passivate defects through coordination bonding, similar to organic cations. Alternatively, when incorporated as intact nanoparticles, MOFs can serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites, guiding the crystallization process to yield perovskite films with superior morphology, larger grain sizes, and reduced grain boundary density. The physical presence of these robust MOF structures at grain boundaries or as an encapsulating layer provides a tortuous path for moisture and oxygen diffusion while also mechanically anchoring the perovskite lattice, which significantly enhances the device's thermal stability and resistance to degradation.",
