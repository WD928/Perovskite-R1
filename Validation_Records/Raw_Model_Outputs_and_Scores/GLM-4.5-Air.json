    "model_output": "Formamidinium iodide (FAI) functions as a precursor additive in perovskite solar cells through a multifaceted mechanism involving crystallization kinetics, defect chemistry, and phase stabilization. \n\n**Crystallization Mechanism**: FAI modulates the crystallization process by altering the supersaturation dynamics of the perovskite precursor solution. The FA⁺ cation, with its larger ionic radius (1.63 Å) compared to methylammonium (MA⁺, 1.76 Å), influences the nucleation and growth rates. By incorporating FAI, the solution achieves a more controlled crystallization front, reducing the formation of pinholes and grain boundaries. This occurs through the temporary formation of intermediate phases (e.g., FA-rich domains) that guide the reorganization into a more uniform perovskite lattice.\n\n**Defect Passivation**: FAI passivates defects through two primary pathways: (1) iodide-rich surfaces at grain boundaries attract FA⁺ cations, which electrostatically stabilize undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites, reducing non-radiative recombination; (2) excess iodide from FAI fills iodide vacancies (V⁻_I), the dominant point defects in perovskites, thereby suppressing trap-assisted recombination. Additionally, FA⁺ can occupy A-site vacancies, mitigating vacancy-mediated ion migration.\n\n**Film Quality and Device Performance**: The optimized crystallization yields larger grains with reduced defect density, enhancing charge carrier mobility and lifetime.

    "reference_answer": "Methylammonium iodide ($MAI$) promotes faster crystallization but may lead to less stable perovskite films, while formamidinium iodide ($FAI$) results in slower crystallization with more stable and ordered perovskite structures due to differences in their cation sizes and interactions with the perovskite lattice.",
    "model_output": "Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) exert distinct influences on perovskite crystallization and stability through differences in cation size, lattice dynamics, and defect interactions.\n\n**Crystallization Mechanism:**\nMAI (smaller cation, ionic radius ~217 pm) promotes faster crystallization due to lower energy barriers for nucleation, often resulting in smaller grains with higher defect density. FAI (larger cation, ionic radius ~250 pm) slows crystallization kinetics, enabling larger grain formation through reduced nucleation density and enhanced ion mobility during crystal growth. This size difference affects the perovskite lattice parameter, with FAI inducing a more expanded cubic lattice that better accommodates halide ions.\n\n**Defect Interactions:**\nMAI exhibits stronger hydrogen bonding with lead iodide, forming intermediate phases that can trap unreacted precursors and increase vacancy defects. FAI's weaker hydrogen bonding reduces intermediate phase formation, decreasing iodide vacancies (V⁻_I) and suppressing halide segregation. The larger FAI cation also creates steric hindrance that impedes ion migration pathways, reducing defect formation energy.\n\n**Film Quality and Stability:**\nMAI-containing films typically show higher initial efficiency but suffer from accelerated degradation due to phase segregation and moisture susceptibility from the smaller cation's higher lattice strain. FAI films demonstrate superior thermal stability (up to 150°C) and reduced phase segregation, though they are more prone to δ-phase formation at low temperatures. Mixed-cation systems (e.g., MA/FA) often optimize these effects by balancing lattice expansion with defect passivation.\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in cation-induced lattice strain and defect energetics: MAI favors rapid but defective crystallization, while FAI promotes slower growth with enhanced thermodynamic stability but requires compositional engineering to mitigate phase instability.",

Methylammonium iodide (MAI) provides methylammonium cations that also interact with metal halide precursors, guiding perovskite crystal growth, filling lattice vacancies for defect passivation, and enhancing charge carrier mobility and collection efficiency, thus increasing PCE.",
    "model_output": "### Differences in Roles of FAI and MAI as Precursor Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells\n\n#### **1. Crystallization Mechanism**\n- **FAI**: The larger formamidinium cation (FA⁺, H₂N⁺=NH₂) promotes slower crystallization due to its steric bulk and lower lattice energy. This facilitates the formation of larger, more uniform grains with reduced pinholes, as the slower kinetics allow for better ion migration and reorganization during film formation.  \n- **MAI**: The smaller methylammonium cation (MA⁺, CH₃NH₃⁺) accelerates crystallization due to higher mobility and stronger electrostatic interactions with iodide. This often results in smaller grains and faster nucleation, which can lead to incomplete coverage or microcracks if uncontrolled.\n\n#### **2. Defect Passivation**\n- **FAI**: Passives undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects via Lewis acid-base interactions, where the amino group (–NH₂) of FA⁺ donates electrons to Pb²⁺. Additionally, FAI reduces iodide vacancies (V⁻ᵢ) by stabilizing the perovskite lattice, suppressing non-radiative recombination.  \n- **MAI**: Primarily passivates iodide vacancies through electrostatic interactions, but its smaller size limits effectiveness in deep-level defect passivation. Excess MAI can lead to phase segregation (e.g., MAPbI₃ formation) or the formation of detrimental MA-rich domains, increasing trap density.\n\n#### **3. Film Quality and Device Performance**\n- **FAI**: Enhances film quality by promoting phase-pure FAPbI₃ (α-phase) when stabilized with additives like Cs⁺ or Br⁻. The larger grains and reduced defect density improve charge carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (Vₒc). However, FAI-rich films are prone to δ-phase formation if humidity control is inadequate.  \n- **MAI**: Improves film homogeneity but often requires co-additives (e.g., MACl) to suppress rapid crystallization. While MAI can boost short-circuit current (Jₛc) due to better band alignment, its tendency to form mixed phases (MA/FA) or halide segregation limits long-term stability and Vₒc.\n\n#### **Key Trade-offs**\n- **FAI** favors superior thermal stability and higher Vₒc but requires precise stoichiometric control to avoid phase instability.  \n- **MAI** offers easier processing and higher Jₛc but compromises defect passivation and stability due to lattice strain and ion migration.  \n\nIn summary, FAI is optimal for high-efficiency, stable devices with controlled crystallization, while MAI is preferred for rapid processing but necessitates additional passivation strategies to mitigate defects.",

During solution processing, excess PbI₂ suppresses rapid crystallization by forming soluble intermediates (e.g., [PbI₄]²⁻ complexes) with organic cations (MA⁺/FA⁺), delaying the perovskite phase transition. This kinetic control promotes a more ordered, defect-tolerant crystallization pathway.\n\n**Interaction with Components/Defects:**  \nPbI₂ passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ and iodide vacancies (V⁻ᵢ) at grain boundaries and surfaces through Lewis acid-base interactions. The unreacted PbI₂ segregates at grain boundaries, forming a 2D/3D heterostructure that suppresses ion migration and non-radiative recombination. Additionally, PbI₂ reduces halide vacancies by occupying lattice sites, mitigating p-type doping and associated Fermi-level pinning.\n\n**Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance:**  \nThe modified crystallization yields larger grains, reduced pinholes, and lower defect densities, enhancing charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths. This improves the open-circuit voltage (Vₒc) and fill factor (FF). While excessive PbI₂ can create recombination centers, optimal concentrations (typically 5–10 mol%) boost power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 10–20% relative to additive-free devices. Furthermore, PbI₂ enhances operational stability by: (1) suppressing ion migration via grain boundary passivation, (2) reducing photo-induced phase segregation, and (3) forming a protective barrier against moisture ingress.

    "model_output": "Precursor additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are chemical compounds incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to modify crystallization kinetics, defect passivation, and film morphology. These additives typically consist of small molecules, polymers, or salts that interact with the perovskite components (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺, PbI₂) or intrinsic defects (e.g., iodide vacancies, interstitials, Pb²⁺ antisites).\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**  \nAdditives primarily function through two mechanisms: (1) **coordination modulation** and (2) **defect passivation**. Coordination modulation occurs when additives (e.g., Lewis bases like thiourea or halides) bind to Pb²⁺ ions, slowing crystallization and promoting uniform nucleation. This reduces grain boundary density and suppresses phase segregation. Defect passivation involves additives occupying undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites or neutralizing halide vacancies (e.g., via ammonium halides like NH₄SCN), which reduces non-radiative recombination.\n\n**Interaction with Perovskite Components/Defects:**  \nAdditives selectively interact with perovskite defects. For instance, bulky cations (e.g., phenethylammonium iodide) segregate at grain boundaries, passivating defects and inhibiting ion migration. Lewis acid-base adducts (e.g., PbCl₂) form intermediate phases that control crystal growth, while halide-based additives (e.g., KI) fill iodide vacancies, reducing deep-level traps.\n\n**Influence on Film Quality and Device Performance:**  \nImproved film quality manifests as larger grains, reduced pinholes, and enhanced crystallinity, leading to higher charge carrier mobility and longer diffusion lengths.

LiI dissociates into Li⁺ and I⁻ ions, where I⁻ passivates undercoordinated Pb²⁺ defects (e.g., Pb-I vacancies) via Lewis acid-base interactions, while Li⁺ may occupy interstitial sites or passivate halide vacancies. MAI, as an organic ammonium salt, primarily passivates defects through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding, with the methylammonium (MA⁺) cation neutralizing iodide vacancies and the I⁻ anion compensating for lead-related defects.\n\n**Interaction with Perovskite Components/Defects:**  \n- **LiI**: The small Li⁺ ion migrates rapidly through the perovskite lattice, passivating deep-level defects (e.g., Pb-I antisites) and suppressing ion migration. However, excess Li⁺ can accumulate at grain boundaries, creating recombination centers.  \n- **MAI**: The bulky MA⁺ preferentially segregates at grain boundaries and surfaces, reducing non-radiative recombination. Its organic nature enhances hydrophobicity but may introduce steric hindrance, limiting defect passivation in bulk regions.\n\n**Impact on Film Quality and Device Performance:**  \n- **LiI**: Improves crystallinity and reduces trap density, enhancing charge carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (Vₒc). However, Li⁺ migration can cause hysteresis and long-term instability, limiting PCE gains (~1-2% absolute improvement).  \n- **MAI**: Enhances surface passivation and film uniformity, reducing interfacial recombination.

    "model_output": "Organic cation-based and MOF-based precursor additives enhance perovskite film quality and device performance through distinct yet complementary mechanisms.\n\n**Organic Cation Additives (e.g., MA⁺, FA⁺, guanidinium):**\nThese small cations primarily interact with the perovskite lattice during crystallization. Guanidinium⁺, for example, segregates at grain boundaries and surfaces, passivating halide vacancies and undercoordinated Pb²⁺ sites. This reduces non-radiative recombination by suppressing defect formation. Additionally, these additives modify crystallization kinetics by coordinating with lead halide species, slowing nucleation and promoting larger grain growth. The resulting films exhibit improved crystallinity, reduced trap density, and enhanced moisture stability due to surface passivation.\n\n**MOF-Based Additives (e.g., Zn-MOF, Cu-MOF):**\nMOFs act as multifunctional templates and reservoirs. Their porous structure releases metal ions (e.g., Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺) and organic ligands that coordinate with PbI₆⁴⁻ octahedra, inhibiting halide vacancy migration. The MOF framework also templates perovskite nucleation, promoting oriented growth and reducing pinholes. Furthermore, MOFs decompose during annealing, leaving behind metal oxides/sulfides that form heterojunctions with the perovskite, improving charge extraction. This dual functionality enhances film morphology, suppresses ion migration, and improves interfacial charge transport.\n\nBoth additive classes ultimately reduce recombination losses and improve device efficiency and operational stability through defect passivation and crystallization control.",
