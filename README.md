This is the official repository for the paper **"Perovskite-R1: A Domain-Specialized LLM for Intelligent Discovery of Precursor Additives and Experimental Design"**.

Perovskite-R1 is a large language model fine-tuned on **QwQ-32B**, specifically designed to assist materials scientists in perovskite synthesis planning, precursor selection, and experimental optimization.

## 🚀 Interactive Demo

We provide a **Gradio-based web interface** that visualizes the model's reasoning process (Chain-of-Thought) separate from the final answer.

### Setup & Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application (specify your model path):
   ```bash
   python app/app.py --model_path /path/to/your/model
   ```

## 🛠 Data Processing Pipeline

The `Preprocess/` folder contains the core scripts used to construct the domain-specific dataset:

* **`pdf2json.py`**: Extracts raw text and metadata from scientific PDFs, converting them into a structured JSON format suitable for training.
* **`gen_paper_cot.py`**: A distillation script that utilizes the **OpenAI o1** model to generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paths based on the raw text.


## 📖 End-to-End Tutorial

For a complete walkthrough of our methodology, please refer to **[Process_Example.ipynb](./Process_Example.ipynb)**.

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the entire workflow, including:
1.  Data Preprocessing and formatting.
2.  Fine-tuning configuration using LLaMA-Factory.
3.  Inference examples.

## 📊 Validation & Integrity

We prioritize transparency and scientific rigor. The **[Validation_Records](./Validation_Records)** directory contains:

* **`check_contamination.py`**: A script to rigorously verify that there is no data leakage between the training set and the benchmark (using N-gram and Semantic analysis).
* **Raw Logs**: Complete inference outputs for Perovskite-R1 and baseline models.
* **Expert Evaluations**: Records of the blind side-by-side human expert review.

For more details on the validation metrics, please check the [README inside the folder](./Validation_Records/README.md).
